["Hiring Team Lila Sciences www.lila.ai Dear Hiring Team, I\u2019m writing to express my enthusiastic interest in the Machine Learning Engineer position at Lila Sciences. With a Master\u2019s degree in Computer Science and a strong focus on large language models, NLP, and applied AI systems, I\u2019m excited by Lila\u2019s mission to bring scientific superintelligence to life. Over the past year, I\u2019ve built and deployed several projects using state-of-the-art generative AI techniques. These include: \u2022", "generative AI techniques. These include: \u2022 Retrieval-Augmented Generation System (GitHub) \u2014 integrates vector databases and local LLMs to enable question-answering over custom PDF documents. \u2022 Text-to-SQL Translator (GitHub) \u2014 turns natural language into SQL queries using prompt engineering and schema parsing. \u2022 Drive-Thru Voice Assistant (GitHub) \u2014 combines speech recognition, LLaMA 3-based order parsing, and gTTS for voice-based interaction, backed by a persistent memory store. These projects", "by a persistent memory store. These projects reflect not only my engineering capability but also a deep understanding of transformer architectures, encoder-decoder mechanisms, attention layers, and inference-time efficiency tradeoffs. I\u2019m also familiar with domain adaptation, RAG pipelines, and evaluation strategies specific to generative and retrieval-based systems. I actively follow developments in the open-source LLM space (e.g., Ollama, Hugging Face Transformers, LoRA fine-tuning), and I\u2019m", "Face Transformers, LoRA fine-tuning), and I\u2019m comfortable working across Python, PyTorch, and cloud-based or on-prem distributed environments. My engineering mindset is complemented by a strong grasp of NLP fundamentals\u2014tokenization, embeddings, attention, context windows, and prompt chaining\u2014which I\u2019ve used to build intelligent, task-specific agents. What excites me most about Lila Sciences is your vision of infusing the scientific method with autonomous, AI-driven discovery. I would love to", "autonomous, AI-driven discovery. I would love to contribute to this bold mission\u2014helping accelerate breakthroughs across health, climate, and materials by scaling ML capabilities and building robust, production-ready systems. Thank you for considering my application. I would be honored to bring my skills and passion for NLP, LLMs, and transformative science to the team at Lila."]
