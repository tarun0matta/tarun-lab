I graduated from university\nin 2014 with a bachelor\u2019s degree and master\u2019s degree in special education but with my", "desire to teach in the classroom snuffed out. Simultaneously overqualified (because of\nmy master\u2019s degree) and underqualified (because I had no work experience, espe-\ncially in anything that didn\u2019t have to do with teaching kids), I made my way to New\nYork City and began looking for a job. It took half a year and hundreds of r\u00e9sum\u00e9s,\nbut I managed to land a job as an IT helpdesk engineer (I applied to be their in-house", "recruiter). While I had never envisioned a career in tech for myself, I suddenly found\nmyself surrounded by computers, servers, printers, and frantic phone calls from\ncoworkers that all required my attention. \n A few years later, I began my exploration into Amazon Web Services and was imme-\ndiately stuck. I had promised my manager at the time that I was going to take the AWS\nCertified Cloud Practitioner exam, but two weeks prior to the exam date I was no", "closer to understanding even what AWS was than I was before I began studying.\n I realized that even though the exam was marketed for those who may have very little\nexperience with IT or AWS, the exam preparation courses had not yet caught up with\nthis new demographic and were mostly reusing content for the more technical certifi-\ncation exams, like the AWS Solutions Architect Associates exam. While there are huge", "overlaps in content, the way the information was presented needed to be modified sub-\nstantially to cater to the new demographic of people who not only are \u201ccloud newbies,\u201d\nbut also \u201cIT newbies\u201d because the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner exam\u2019s target demo-\ngraphic doesn\u2019t necessarily have legacy IT infrastructure background (or vocabulary).\nPREFACE xi\n After a lot of back and forth with myself on how to best prepare for the certifica-", "tion exam, I created awsnewbies.com  as my own exam study guide. I used it myself to\npass the certification exam and decided to leave it up for a year, hoping it may help\none or two other people. \n Things escalated very quickly after that. Within a few months, I had a contract with\nLinkedIn Learning to create online video courses with them to introduce Amazon\nWeb Services to people with no technical backgrounds. \u201cIntroduction to AWS for", "Non-Engineers\u201d ( introtoaws.com ) was a huge hit, and the courses were recently trans-\nlated into Spanish and Portuguese! \n There was a definite pain point in people wanting to learn about cloud computing\nand Amazon Web Services, but not knowing where to find beginner-friendly, jargon-\nfree resources to get started. Through my work creating beginner-friendly content\nand teaching hundreds of thousands of people who were eager to learn, I had the", "honor of being named an AWS Community Hero in 2020.\n When I received an email from Manning wondering if I\u2019d be interested in writing\nan introductory AWS book, I decided that a reference book would supplement my\nother content very well in helping people break into cloud computing and Amazon\nWeb Services. People have all sorts of learning styles, and some people learn better\nvisually or with audio and others, by reading. This book, along with video courses and", "a website, would help cater to all those types of learners!\nxiiacknowledgments\nI\u2019d like to thank my mother, without whom I wouldn\u2019t be here (literally), who nursed\nme back to health after my brain surgery. She allowed me to explore the world to find\nout what I can \u201cstill do\u201d despite my new brain injury, even though it was probably one\nof the scariest things she could do as a mother. \n I\u2019d also like to thank my husband, who has been a relentless cheerleader from the", "beginning of my out-of-the-box career maneuvers, believing there was something\nthere even when I wasn\u2019t convinced.\n There are countless people I owe for giving me a spotlight or a hand to pull me up\na step as I began exploring the world of AWS and helping other AWS newbies learn\nabout the cloud\u2014many of whom I have yet to even meet in person.

Let\u2019s get started!\n1.1 What is cloud computing?\nEven if you don\u2019t currently work in IT, you might be familiar with file sharing , where", "you can share with other computers the files, documents, and other electronic data\nthat reside in your computer. Your work computer may have the ability to receive data\nfrom powerful computers called servers , where different users upload resources to\nshare with their team or department. It might be where your marketing department\nsaves branding and marketing graphics or your sales team saves contract templates. \n3 1.1 What is cloud computing?", "3 1.1 What is cloud computing?\n Until recently, all of this data sharing happened on premises  or within your com-\npany\u2019s office, such as in a server room, or in separate secured buildings known as data\ncenters . With cloud computing, all of the physical IT infrastructure such as setting up\nserver rooms, data centers, and purchasing and configuring physical servers is now\ntaken care of by the cloud computing service providers such as AWS, Microsoft Azure,", "and Google Cloud Platform. We can now share resources and data with other comput-\ners using the internet instead of having to rely on our on-premises IT resources. \n AWS  (or AWS Cloud) is a cloud computing platform offered by the tech giant Ama-\nzon. To fully appreciate what AWS does, we need to back up and first define what\ncloud computing is. Cloud computing , according to AWS, is the \u201con-demand delivery of\nIT resources over the internet with pay-as-you-go pricing\u201d ( https:/ / aws.amazon", ".com/what-is-cloud-computing/ ). In the most basic terms, cloud computing allows\nusers to access IT resources using the internet instead of relying on whatever you have\non hand locally (such as in your office). Instead of backing up your important files to\nyour floppy disks (remember those?) or external hard drives, you can now back them\nup to the \u201ccloud\u201d by utilizing cloud computing services such as Box, Dropbox, and\nGoogle Drive.", "Google Drive.\n On top of that, cloud computing services utilize pay-as-you-go pricing for their\nresources. Previously, when you wanted new IT equipment, you would make the pur-\nchase, paying for the whole piece of equipment up front. With pay-as-you-go pricing\nfor cloud services, you only pay for however much IT resources you use, when you use\nthem, as if you\u2019re paying your electricity or water bill.\n IT infrastructure  refers to all of the software and hardware components that make", "up a technical ecosystem. These can range from physical components such as data\ncenters, servers, and computers to software components such as operating systems\nand specific pieces of software utilized in the company, such as Microsoft Office. In\nthe context of this book, IT infrastructure can be physical, as in physical hardware,\nserver rooms, or data centers, or virtual, as in accessed using the internet. You can\nthink of it as everything you need to make sure your IT department is running", "smoothly.\n Currently, I am writing this manuscript using Google Docs, a Google Cloud Plat-\nform service. I share manuscript drafts with my editor, and she, in turn, shares\nresources saved in cloud storage folders to help me edit and format my writing.

A decade or two before, the process of writing a book was very different. I may\nhave still been writing on a computer, but I would probably save the file onto a floppy\ndisk or USB drive and have in-person meetings with the editor. You, too, may be utiliz-\ning cloud computing platforms and services in many different parts of your work and\npersonal life.\n Globally, cloud computing has brought a huge change in the ways we interact with", "each other, work, and spend our days. Services such as Dropbox, Facebook, Google\n4 CHAPTER  1Introduction to cloud computing and Amazon Web Services\nDrive, and Slack that help us work and play are all fueled by cloud computing, and\nchances are, all of these major services are hosted on one of the few major cloud\ncomputing platforms.

You are a\nfreelance graphic designer and need to run heavy (requires a lot of computing power\nto run efficiently) design and image editing software on it. You\u2019ll also be saving large\nfiles such as images, videos, and iterations of projects, which means you need a lot of\nstorage.

Many services we take for granted these days, such as\ncloud-based email (Gmail, Yahoo! Mail), cloud storage (Dropbox, iCloud), streaming\nservices (Netflix, Hulu), and social media (Twitter, Facebook), utilize cloud comput-\ning to provide us with quick, affordable, reliable, and on-demand services. Many of us\nrely on at least one cloud computing-based service every single day, whether it be", "using Google Maps to navigate to a Mexican restaurant, backing up photos from our\nphones to Google Photos, or asking Amazon Alexa for the weather forecast. Even your\nfavorite vacuuming robot likely utilizes cloud computing to map out your house to\nclean more efficiently. \n Gone are the days when we had to walk around with a USB thumb drive to move\nfiles from computer to computer, print out map directions from MapQuest, or buy", "DVDs to watch our favorite movies for the 50th time. Thanks to cloud computing, we\ncan access files, real-time driving directions, movies, and much more instantaneously\nthrough the internet.\n As the largest cloud computing platform in the world, Amazon Web Services, also\ncommonly referred to as AWS Cloud or AWS, has played a vital role in making sure we\nconsume more content via the internet than ever before. Hosting websites and IT", "infrastructures of countless well-known companies such as Airbnb, Adobe, Disney,\nComcast, Capital One, and McDonald\u2019s, AWS has been directly impacting our daily\nlives for years. Being a big player in the IT world as well as our daily lives, AWS and\ncloud computing are both worth learning about as we get more deeply entrenched in\nthe digital world.\n In chapter 2, we begin learning about the different cloud concepts that help differ-", "entiate cloud computing from legacy on-premises IT infrastructure (think: physical\nserver rooms and data centers). We discover advantages of cloud computing, types of\ncloud computing models and deployments, and design principles in cloud computing.\n1.3 When should I use or not use cloud computing?\nAs with any product or service, there are situations where you should or shouldn\u2019t uti-\nlize cloud computing to solve your IT needs. AWS, as a whole, is considered an Infra-", "structure as a Service  (IaaS) platform. We will go more in depth on what IaaS is in later\nchapters, but in a nutshell, it means that AWS provides all the tools necessary for you\nto set up and maintain IT infrastructure by helping you customize and build a cloud-\nbased IT infrastructure for a fraction of the cost and time of setting up a physical\nhardware-based IT infrastructure in your office or data center. As the name suggests, it\nprovides (IT) infrastructure as a service.", "provides (IT) infrastructure as a service.\n1.3.1 When should I use cloud computing?\nThere are many reasons cloud computing has swept up the technical world like a\ntornado, influencing everything from government to corporate IT to personal lives.\nWhen utilized productively, cloud computing can make IT solutions more affordable,\n6 CHAPTER  1Introduction to cloud computing and Amazon Web Services\nflexible, reliable, and/or efficient than what we used to utilize for our legacy IT\ninfrastructure.", "infrastructure.\n Utilizing cloud computing services can help teams quickly scale their resources,\nsuch as compute or database resources, up or down depending on demand. Need\nmore capacity? You can get it almost instantaneously. Need less capacity? Turning it\ndown a notch is almost instantaneous too! And with a pay-for-what-you-use model of\nbilling, you end up paying only for the IT resources you utilized, so you aren\u2019t stuck", "with a huge bill at the end of the month for all the resources you didn\u2019t use. \n Are you an online shop running a once-a-year mega sale and expecting potential\ncustomers rushing to your website to increase by 100-fold?

This allows your excited customers to flood your online shop without the\nthreat of crashing your website.", "threat of crashing your website. \n Your sale is now over, and the number of customers returns to normal. That\u2019ll\nmean that your increased cloud computing resources are no longer necessary. No\nproblem! You can scale down your resource usage instantaneously so that you don\u2019t\nkeep on paying the extra fees associated with the added resources. With physical hard-\nware and infrastructure, it is more difficult to scale your resources up or down,", "because it would require purchasing expensive equipment that may take a while to\narrive and set up. Not to mention, when you no longer need the equipment, you\u2019re\nusually stuck with it.\n Another reason cloud computing may be a better choice for your IT infrastructure\nis the fact that not only can you access a virtually limitless amount of resources almost\ninstantaneously, but you can also rely on its security and reliability. Have you ever lost", "months\u2019 worth of work because of a hard drive failure on your computer or needed\nan important file for a meeting but misplaced your thumb drive? Perhaps some sensi-\ntive documents got lost somewhere on a thumb drive, causing the compliance depart-\nment to scramble to attempt to retrieve it before a competitor got hold of it. AWS and\nother cloud computing platforms take the reliability, durability, and security of your", "IT resources very seriously. As a result, losing or misplacing data becomes a much\nrarer issue.\n Not only can you rely on cloud computing platforms to hold your data securely\nand confidently, but you can also rely on them to make data access much more conve-\nnient in both work life and personal life. If you\u2019ve ever utilized a service such as Box\nor Dropbox to store or share files with friends or messaged your colleagues or family", "on a messaging app such as Facebook Messenger, Google Hangout, or Microsoft\nTeams, you\u2019re utilizing cloud computing to access and share resources and informa-\ntion more efficiently and conveniently than ever before!\n Ok, so now we know cloud computing is pretty cool (right?). But why should we be\nlooking into AWS over other large cloud computing platforms such as Microsoft\nAzure and Google Cloud? Every platform and service provider has different strengths", "and weaknesses, and AWS is not an exception. And I\u2019m obviously biased, having spent\n7 1.3 When should I use or not use cloud computing?\nthe past few years talking about AWS. However, the most enticing aspect of consider-\ning AWS as a cloud IT solution over other cloud computing providers is probably its\nsheer size, in terms of both market share and breadth of products being offered.\n Even if you don\u2019t end up utilizing AWS, or you decide to work at a company that", "uses another cloud computing platform, because of the similarities between AWS ser-\nvices and concepts we discuss in detail throughout this book and their counterparts in\nother major cloud computing platforms, you will likely have a much easier time get-\nting up to speed with any of them. A virtual server is a virtual server, whether it\u2019s called\nAmazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) or Azure Virtual Machine.\n AWS has steadily held the top market share in the cloud computing platform space", "since its launch in 2006 and provides services ranging from compute and storage to\nthe Internet of Things, mobile, and even satellites. Thanks partly to its enormous cus-\ntomer base and variety of industries served, AWS is able to provide diverse types of ser-\nvices to fit its clients\u2019 needs at very competitive prices. Chances are, your IT and\ndevelopment teams will be able to find a service or a group of services that fulfills their", "goals by utilizing AWS. If not, at least you can utilize the knowledge you glean from\nthis book to jump-start your cloud computing journey in other platforms.\n1.3.2 When should I not use cloud computing?\nAs exciting and innovative as cloud computing can be, it\u2019s not always the best solution\nfor your IT problems or needs. Fundamentally, because cloud computing requires you\nto access IT resources using the internet, if your internet connection goes down,", "you\u2019re in a pickle. If there is a network outage in your area or in the area hosting the\ndata center, there\u2019s a problem. In a related vein, if the platform itself goes down,\nwhether due to network issues, massive hardware failures, or worse, the company\ngoing out of business, you are in a massive  pickle. \n Another issue that can potentially be a deal breaker for people who need\nextremely quick access to their IT resources may be the latency . Latency in IT is the", "time it takes for data to get from one place to another. Just as with shipping packages,\nthe farther data has to travel, the longer it takes to arrive. Working on files on your\nworkstation (laptop or desktop computer) has the lowest latency, because you are\naccessing the files directly on your local hard drive. Working off a local server  (a server\nthat is housed in your office\u2019s server room) may cause a slight delay, but that delay", "would be much shorter than accessing the same files using the internet (and rarely\nperceptible for us mere mortals). \n In the case of cloud computing, because the data is being accessed using the inter-\nnet, the speed at which the data can be uploaded or downloaded is heavily reliant on\nthe speed of the internet between you and the data center hosting your resources. For\nmost of us, these differences are almost imperceptible and do not cause workflow", "issues, but for those who rely on instantaneous updates or resource access because of\nthe nature of their work, these slight delays may be a deal breaker. Having latency over\na certain limit may be detrimental for people such as stock brokers who need almost\n8 CHAPTER  1Introduction to cloud computing and Amazon Web Services\nno latency in receiving information and executing stock transactions. These are issues\nyou encounter because you are relying on a company to host your resources in a", "remote location, which requires a secure and fast internet connection to access.\n Another reason you or your company may decide to not utilize cloud computing is\nthe fact that, depending on your location, it may not be available at all or its offerings\nmay be limited. For example, as of the writing of this book in 2022, there is only one\nAWS Region in the whole continent of Africa (Cape Town) and one in South America", "(S\u00e3o Paulo). There are none in Russia or North Korea and just one in the huge coun-\ntry of Canada (the second one is coming to Alberta in 2023\u20132024). \n Not only are there certain countries and regions in the world where cloud comput-\ning access may not be available, but there are also discrepancies in the types of\nresources and services offered by location. For example, it is a widely accepted fact\nthat with AWS Cloud, the East Coast and West Coast of the United States are regions", "that have more variety of services and tend to receive newer services first. Other\nregions such as Singapore, Sydney, Tokyo, and Frankfurt are also known to have access\nto a more diverse selection of services.\n Some industries and situations may not be as conducive to using cloud computing\nover legacy on-premises IT infrastructure. An example could be a situation we reviewed\nearlier, where the users are doing types of work that require virtually zero latency.", "Another barrier could be compliance issues and security concerns. While AWS has\nbeen strengthening its government-servicing branch, hosting government resources\nwill obviously have many different security-related issues and concerns than most non-\ngovernmental entities. If all the regulations are not addressed, government agencies\nare unable to utilize the AWS Cloud. Another industry that has a lot of compliance-", "related restrictions is the medical industry. Because much of the data stored by medical\nindustries such as hospitals is extremely sensitive in nature, there are many regulations\nsurrounding how and where data can be stored, both in the hospital\u2019s own compliance\nrules as well as at the government level. While rapid progress is being made to onboard\nthe healthcare industry onto the cloud, depending on how the rules are written, many", "in the medical industry are still unable to store their data in the cloud.\n There are many reasons why cloud computing may be a fit for your unique situa-\ntions and needs, and there may be equally as many reasons why it may not be a fit. It\u2019s\nimportant to make sure that you are choosing a solution that meets your specific\nrequirements in all different aspects, ranging from financial and regulatory to effi-\nciency and ease of use.", "ciency and ease of use.\n As a side note, when you are on a hunt to solve an IT issue, you may be looking for\na solution  instead of a platform . For example, say you are an IT manager looking for an\naffordable and efficient way of managing your company\u2019s emails and file sharing for\nemployees. You could  cobble together a solution using different services AWS offers.\nAlternatively, you could sign up for a subscription with Google Workspace (formerly G", "Suite), and almost instantaneously have access to user management, email, file stor-\nage and sharing, instant messaging system, calendar system, and much more. \n9 1.4 Conceptualizing cloud computing and AWS\n As we mentioned earlier, AWS Cloud as a whole is an IaaS platform. AWS has many\ngreat features and services, but sometimes you\u2019re looking for a quick solution to a spe-\ncific problem you\u2019re having and not an entire platform. In those cases, you may opt to", "purchase a ready-made service offered by another company instead of piecing\ntogether a custom solution using different AWS services. While this is definitely not a\nstrike against utilizing cloud computing in general over legacy infrastructure (rather,\na potential strike against utilizing a whole platform as opposed to a ready-made solu-\ntion), it may be food for thought when comparing different cloud computing plat-", "forms (IaaS) versus Software as a Service products such as Facebook and Gmail. We\ndiscover the different types of cloud computing models in chapter 2.\n1.4 Conceptualizing cloud computing and AWS\nIf what we\u2019ve been talking about in this chapter seems rather confusing and nebulous,\nyou aren\u2019t alone. Creating a mental model of what all of the concepts and terminolo-\ngies mean, as well as what fits in where, is difficult when tackling cloud computing,\nwith or without an IT background.", "with or without an IT background.\n1.4.1 Cloud computing, AWS, and you\nThe most fundamental mental model we want to establish is the relationship between\nyou, the user, and the IT resources that \u201clive in the cloud.\u201d Generally speaking, you\nwould access the IT resources hosted on cloud computing platforms, such as AWS, via\nthe internet on your local machine (usually a computer).\n As a scenario, let\u2019s imagine that your IT department decided to move the graphic", "design team\u2019s digital assets from a local server  (a server that exists physically in the\noffice) to a virtual server  (a server that is hosted by a cloud computing platform) on\nAWS.\n Let\u2019s take a look at figure 1.1, which shows your home Wi-Fi network\u2019s relationship\nto AWS.

In our server room example, purchasing IT equipment is a capital expense", "because the company pays a lot of money, likely up front, to acquire the assets neces-\nsary to build it. \n Another feature of running a successful organization is managing operational\nexpenses  (OpEx). Operational expenses are expenses that a company incurs while con-\nducting normal business operations.

As with cloud comput-\ning models, cloud computing deployments differ in how much control you have over\nthe system. A lot also has to do with where your IT infrastructure will reside. The three\ntypes of cloud computing deployments are as follows:\n\uf0a1Cloud/cloud native\n\uf0a1Hybrid\n\uf0a1On-premises", "\uf0a1Cloud/cloud native\n\uf0a1Hybrid\n\uf0a1On-premises\n2.4.1 Cloud/cloud-native deployment\nCloud deployment , or cloud-native deployment, is what many people imagine when they\nthink about cloud computing. All parts of the application or the infrastructure are\ndeployed, or \u201clive,\u201d on the cloud. Users access these resources on the cloud via the\ninternet. These applications can be created in the cloud or be migrated onto the\ncloud from existing physical infrastructure (for example, moving data from your com-", "puter\u2019s hard drive to Dropbox).\n When we compose our text on WordPress\u2019s text editor, edit some photos on Canva,\nand publish a blog post, the whole process of updating our blog is utilizing cloud\ndeployment. You get the full benefit of cost, labor, and time savings that comes with\ncloud computing when you use cloud deployment.\n2.4.2 Hybrid deployment\nAlthough cloud computing comes with many benefits, one downside is that your", "information travels through the internet. The fact that data travels through the inter-\nnet is not an issue in most cases, thanks to improvements in data transfer speeds in\nrecent decades. However, when dealing with extremely large amounts of data on the\ncloud, the lag can become noticeable. Sometimes, a business can rely so much on the\ndata that any lag can be problematic for its day-to-day operations.

Hybrid", "deployment connects cloud-based infrastructure with existing resources that reside on\nphysical computers and servers on-site. \n2.4.3 On-premises deployment\nSometimes referred to as private cloud , on-premises deployment is the deployment of\nresources on-premises, or on-site, which utilizes virtualization and resource manage-\nment tools offered by cloud computing. Virtualization  is the act of creating a virtual\nversion of something. In the case of cloud computing, servers and computers are", "often created as virtual machines. This means that you can use these computers and\nservers as though you are using a physical computer or server, but they exist as soft-\nware instead of hardware.\n Since everything is local, or on-site, and not uploaded to the cloud, it\u2019s a little\nharder to see the benefits of cloud computing when you use on-premises deployment.\nFrom the outside, everything might look very similar to a legacy, or traditional, IT", "infrastructure that we are familiar with from the precloud era. Companies utilizing\non-premises deployment may still have their physical server rooms and data centers. \n You can conceptualize on-premises deployment as utilizing the technologies of\ncloud computing (such as virtualization and resource management) in a physical IT\ninfrastructure.

Security is an important part of an IT infrastruc-\nture both on the cloud and on-site. The cloud computing platforms and the custom-", "ers share the responsibilities of keeping the infrastructure and data secured.\n Different components of security should be considered, such as user access man-\nagement (don\u2019t share passwords; force password changes periodically; don\u2019t give per-\nmission to resources a user does not need), resource management (keep data secured\nin transit and at rest; protect all layers of infrastructure, not just one), and making", "sure that when a security event occurs, there are procedures and traceability put in\nplace to figure out what went wrong and prevent it from happening again.

In the most fundamental sense, the principle of least privilege dic-\ntates that you should only provide access to resources and information as needed. For", "example, everyone in the company shouldn\u2019t have access to payroll or other human\nresources information. Likewise, the whole IT department probably does not need to\nbe able to log into the backup server when an engineer is present who is responsible for\nmaintaining daily backups of corporate servers.

If not, something that could have caused catastrophic damage to\nthe company was avoided, thanks to the automated security event response! \n In a similar vein, enabling traceability  to monitor alerts and logs that tell you who\ndid what and when is important, as knowing where the breach happened and why will\nhelp administrators make sure that similar future breaches do not occur.

You may\nrecall that there are three types of cloud computing deployments:", "\uf0a1Cloud/cloud native\n\uf0a1Hybrid\n\uf0a1On-premises\nLet\u2019s quickly review the three types of cloud computing deployment.\n Cloud deployment, or cloud-native deployment, is what most people imagine\nwhen they think about cloud computing. The entire IT infrastructure lives on the\nservers of the chosen cloud computing platform, and you access these resources using\nthe internet. \n Hybrid deployment is often used when a company is in the process of moving its", "data fully onto the cloud to make cloud deployment a reality but has not yet com-\npleted the process. It is also often utilized when a company sets up automatic backups\nfrom its servers or employee computers on a predetermined, consistent schedule to\nhave up-to-date copies of important data in the cloud. It connects cloud-based infra-\nstructure with existing on-premises IT resources, allowing a company to utilize both\ncloud computing\u2013powered and on-site physical IT resources together.", "On-premises deployment is sometimes referred to as a private cloud . It is hard to\ngrasp the value of utilizing on-premises deployment when we are talking about cloud\ncomputing. It seems counterintuitive to use cloud computing when all IT resources\nare housed in physical data centers and server rooms on-site. However, cloud comput-\ning platforms can still offer benefits such as virtualization to companies that use an on-\npremise IT infrastructure.\n3.2.3 Connectivity options in the AWS Cloud", "3.2.3 Connectivity options in the AWS Cloud\nWhile we learned about different ways you can communicate  with the AWS Cloud in sec-\ntion 3.2.1, there are also a few different ways you can connect  to the AWS Cloud. Con-\nnectivity options are ways you can establish network connections to create the\nhighways of data transfers back and forth between your local device and the AWS\nCloud. Some of the options that are especially relevant when considering sitting for", "the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner exam are as follows:\n\uf0a1Virtual private network (VPN)\n\uf0a1AWS Direct Connect\n\uf0a1Public internet\n56 CHAPTER  3Deploying and operating in AWS global infrastructure\nFigure 3.3 diagrams mental models of the ways you can connect to cloud computing\nresources with your local devices while utilizing a VPN and the public internet.\nWhen you first create an AWS account, you find that AWS creates an Amazon Virtual", "Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) for you. Amazon VPC is a private, isolated corner of AWS,\nwhere you can begin building your IT infrastructure. Consider that your home Wi-Fi\nnetwork is a private network where you can house your devices, like a printer, tablet,\ncomputer, and phone, and the network is isolated from everyone else\u2019s Wi-Fi network.\nAWS VPC is a virtual network that is also isolated from other virtual networks so that", "other customers don\u2019t have access to your IT infrastructure housed in Amazon VPC.\n Because Amazon VPC is a virtual network housed in AWS, you must be able to con-\nnect to it from your local computer or server. Let\u2019s find out what some of these con-\nnectivity options are!\nVIRTUAL  PRIVATE  NETWORK\nWhile AWS does offer a service called AWS VPN, the concept of a VPN is not original\nto AWS. The technology dates back to the mid-1990s, when a Microsoft employee cre-", "ated a \u201cpeer-to-peer tunneling protocol\u201d that helped to pave the way for a more secure\nconnection between a local device and the internet.\n A VPN provides privacy and security online by creating an encrypted private net-\nwork between your device and the resource you are connecting to, even when you are\nutilizing a public internet connection. VPNs hide your IP address, which means that\nwho you are and what you are doing becomes harder for snoopers to trace. You might", "have some friends who use VPNs to connect to streaming websites that are region-\nblocked to watch their favorite movies or TV shows not available in their own coun-\ntries. This can happen because the VPN service they are utilizing hides their real loca-\ntion from the streaming servers.Public internet\nEncrypted, secured VPN connectionPublic internet connection\nFigure 3.3 There are different ways your local devices can connect to the AWS \nCloud. Two examples are the public internet and VPNs.", "57 3.2 Deploying and operating in AWS\n AWS is one of countless VPN services available. Its VPN service is called AWS Virtual\nPrivate Network  and consists of AWS Client VPN and AWS Site-to-Site VPN. AWS VPN\ncreates secure connections between your on-premises networks and AWS\u2019s global\nnetwork.\n AWS Client VPN  allows your remote workers to securely connect to resources in the\nAWS Cloud and your on-premises networks  (network in your office or data center). AWS", "Site-to-Site VPN  enables you to create secured connections between different locations\n(like your multiple offices and data centers) and the AWS Cloud. The distinction\nseems a bit murky, especially if these terms are new. However, for the purposes of this\nbook, which is to expose you to different concepts assuming you don\u2019t need to turn\naround and configure them, you might think of the difference between AWS Client", "VPN and AWS Site-to-Site VPN like this: Client VPN utilizes single-user connections\n(for example, a laptop to a certain network), while Site-to-Site VPNs connect entire\nnetworks together (for example, office network with another office network).

It creates a secure, private connection between your local network and\nAWS, which means that it bypasses the public internet.

(There may be more than one answer.)\naAWS Management Console\nbAWS SDKs\ncAWS CloudFormation\ndAWS Chime\n3.3 AWS global infrastructure", "dAWS Chime\n3.3 AWS global infrastructure\nWith its presence in every continent except Antarctica and serving 245 countries and\nterritories, Amazon\u2019s infrastructure is truly global. As of 2022, the AWS Cloud spans 81\nAvailability Zones (AZs) and 25 Regions, with 27 more AZs and 9 more Regions in the\n59 3.3 AWS global infrastructure\nworks. AWS boasts two times more Regions with multiple AZs than the next largest\ncloud computing platform. With millions of active customers across virtually every", "industry, it has the largest and most dynamic cloud ecosystem in the world.\n Having such a global footprint allows AWS to provide security, availability, perfor-\nmance, scalability, and flexibility to its customers. A big part of understanding how the\nAWS global infrastructure operates is learning about the relationships between AWS\nRegions , AZs, and Edge Locations .\n3.3.1 Regions\nAWS Regions are physical locations around the globe where AWS clusters data centers", "called Availability Zones. Each Region has two or more AZs, serving customers in the\nphysical areas around them. As of the beginning of 2022, AWS had 25 geographic\nRegions, with plans for 9 more coming to previously underserved areas of the world.\n When creating an AWS infrastructure, you should choose to house it in the Region\nand AZ physically closest to you to get the highest performance possible. One thing to\nkeep in mind is that not all Regions or AZs are made equal, and some services are", "available only in certain Regions or AZs. AWS\u2019s general policy is that it will make new\nservices and features available to all AWS Regions within 12 months of general avail-\nability when possible. \n Each Region is completely isolated from the others so that if one Region goes\ndown due to a human-made or natural disaster, the other Regions remain unaffected.\nDesigning each Region to be completely isolated provides the greatest possible fault\ntolerance and stability for your IT infrastructure.", "UTILIZING  MULTIPLE  AWS R EGIONS\nWith the understanding that each AWS Region is completely isolated from every other\nRegion, your company may opt to utilize multiple AWS Regions, often replicating the\ndata hosted in one Region to another. Replicating data in multiple Regions may help\nwith business continuity or data recovery, because when one Region loses data or has\nan outage, you can immediately jump over to your other Regions to maintain business", "continuity. This concept is called fault tolerance . \n Fault tolerance is the ability of a system to stay operational even if parts of the sys-\ntem fail. In this case, even if one Region fails, because the resources and data are rep-\nlicated in one or more other Regions, your business can remain operational. As an\nadded bonus, when your resources are replicated in multiple Regions, when one\nRegion fails and the data is lost, there are multiple copies of the same data in other", "unaffected Regions. While fault tolerance is great for keeping your infrastructure up\nand running despite bumps and jolts that come with the real world (and real natural\ndisasters), it can potentially get rather expensive. \n Hosting resources in multiple AWS Regions can also provide low latency for end\nusers, as they can access the AWS-hosted resources via data centers in the Region clos-\nest to their physical presence. If your online course streaming company\u2019s physical", "presence is in Virginia, USA, and you host your resources in the US East Region\n60 CHAPTER  3Deploying and operating in AWS global infrastructure\n(Region name: N. Virginia; Region: us-east-1), your customers from Seoul, South\nKorea may have latency issues when trying to stream your videos. By having replicated\ndata in the Asia Pacific Region (Region name: Seoul; Region: ap-northeast-2), you can\nmake sure your customers in Asia Pacific can enjoy the same user experience that your", "US customers do.\n Different countries and territories have different regulations and laws when it comes\nto storing data, which is referred to as data sovereignty . AWS has powerful tools that allow\nyou to control where your data is stored, how it is secured, and who can access it. When\nyou utilize AWS services, you can remain confident that your data stays within the AWS\nRegion that you selected to house the resources. Utilizing multiple AWS Regions allows", "you to control where every piece of your data is stored to stay within regulations in each\nof the territories and countries in which your company operates.\n3.3.2 Availability Zones\nEach AWS Region has two or more AZs, which are discrete data centers with redundant\npower, networking, and connectivity. Each AZ may have one or more data centers,\nand all AZs in a single Region are interconnected with high-bandwidth, low-latency\nnetworking.", "networking. \n In layperson\u2019s terms, this means that the data transfer speed between AZs in a sin-\ngle Region is lightning fast. AWS states that each AZ is physically separate from other\nAZs in the same AWS Region by a meaningful distance, but they are within 60 miles of\neach other. What does that mean for the roundtrip latency of data? It\u2019s usually within\na few milliseconds! That\u2019s superfast!\n Figure 3.5 diagrams how AWS Regions are distinct physical locations around the", "world with two or more AZs.

You can also utilize multiple AZs (in multiple Regions, if you choose) to\nmake your resources more highly available, resilient, and accessible to customers\neverywhere.\nUTILIZING  MULTIPLE  AVAILABILITY  ZONES\nAll AZs, even within a single Region, are separated by a meaningful distance (but they\nreside within 60 miles of each other), which means that when natural disasters such as\nearthquakes, tornadoes, or lightning strikes bring one AZ down, other AZs in the same", "Region can take over or continue operations. When you host or replicate your\nresources in multiple AZs, no single AZ becomes a single point of failure because each\nAZ has its own power, networking, and connectivity, as well as servers (they are data\ncenters, after all!). Utilizing multiple AZs allows your AWS Cloud resources to achieve\nhigh availability. You can design your AWS Cloud infrastructure to fail over\nautomatically between AZs to avoid interruptions when one malfunctions or goes", "down. Utilizing multiple AZs to host your resources allows you to achieve highly\navailable, fault-tolerant, and scalable IT infrastructure in the AWS Cloud.\n3.3.3 Edge Locations\nEdge Locations  are physical data centers that Amazon CloudFront uses to cache copies\nof your data for faster content delivery to users. (We learn about Amazon CloudFront\nin more detail in a few paragraphs, but in a nutshell, it is an AWS service that speeds", "up distribution of web content by utilizing caching.) They exist at the closest location\nto your end users so that there is the lowest latency possible when delivering requested\ndata. \n Data caching  refers to the concept of keeping data and files temporarily in a special\nstorage space to make websites, devices, and applications run more efficiently. When\nyou visit your favorite news site, you are likely not reloading every single piece of infor-", "mation, image, and video every time you visit. Your browser keeps a  cache of data so\nthat only parts (often the updated parts) of the web page are reloaded in subsequent\nvisits. This helps to cut down on loading time (data latency) so you can have a very\nefficient browsing experience scrolling through all of your cat memes (no judgment). Fault tolerance vs. high availability\nWhat\u2019s the difference? A little confusing? I totally get it!", "Achieving high availability requires replicating resources within AZs within the same\nRegion. It is less costly than achieving fault tolerance, which requires replication in\nmultiple  Regions. \nFault-tolerant infrastructures are, by nature, highly available (as they also replicate\nresources within each Region), but highly available infrastructures are not necessarily\nfault tolerant (unless they are also replicating to multiple Regions).", "62 CHAPTER  3Deploying and operating in AWS global infrastructure\n AWS has Edge Locations to do the same thing your browser does when it visits web-\nsites so that its users can download data from the closest point possible. Let\u2019s go back\nto the example of an online video course company physically located in Virginia, USA,\nwith its Region of choice and AZs located in the East Coast of the United States. With-\nout Edge Locations, the video content a customer in Seoul, South Korea wants to", "watch has to be streamed from data centers halfway across the globe. Thankfully,\nbecause Edge Locations physically closest to the customer in Seoul will cache the data\nonce the first person downloads it (sorry, first person\u2014you had to suffer the long load\ntime), all subsequent users based in that area will be able to stream videos directly\nfrom the closest Edge Location, improving their user experience. \nAMAZON  CLOUDFRONT", "AMAZON  CLOUDFRONT\n What powers all of this caching is Amazon CloudFront , an AWS service that speeds\nup the distribution of static and dynamic web content by caching the content at Edge\nLocations.

By routing each request to the user\u2019s\nclosest Edge Location, AWS Global Accelerator throws the requests onto the high-\nspeed, congestion-free AWS global network. When the ticketing website\u2019s owner\nenables AWS Global Accelerator, users trying to grab a ticket can get on the \u201cinternet", "freeway\u201d and make their purchases efficiently.

Previously, to acquire computing power, you had to physically purchase\na computer or server with technical specifications that matched your needs. \n This process was both costly and time-consuming because purchasing a physical\nmachine required upfront capital, and the procurement process could take weeks, if", "not months. You had to choose the appropriate machine, get it approved by the\nbosses/finance/management, make the order, and receive the order. Now, thanks to\ncloud computing\u2019s pay-as-you-go model, you only pay for what you use without long-\nterm contracts or complex licensing that bloats costs in legacy IT infrastructure.\n There are a few different categories of AWS compute services. The categories help\nyou to quickly identify their purposes such as virtual machines versus cost and capacity", "management. They are as follows:\n\uf0a1Instances (virtual machines) \u2014Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2),\nAmazon Lightsail\n\uf0a1Containers \u2014Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS), Amazon Fargate\n\uf0a1Serverless \u2014AWS Lambda\n\uf0a1Edge and hybrid \u2014AWS Outposts, AWS Wavelength\n\uf0a1Cost and capacity management \u2014AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Elastic Load Balancing\n(ELB)\nThese categories of AWS compute services allow users to achieve a variety of computa-", "tional goals ranging from deploying a secure virtual machine (a server running on\ncloud computing) in the cloud with Amazon EC2 to running code without worrying\nabout maintaining servers with AWS Lambda.\n In this section, we examine the following core AWS compute services:\n\uf0a1Amazon EC2\n\uf0a1AWS Elastic Beanstalk\n\uf0a1ELB\n\uf0a1AWS Lambda\n\uf0a1Amazon ECS\n4.1.1 Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud\nAmazon Elastic Compute Cloud, more commonly referred to as Amazon EC2 (Get it?", "Compute Cloud? C2?), is arguably one of the most popular and highly utilized ser-\nvices AWS offers. Amazon EC2 is a scalable cloud computing service that gives you the\nability to quickly configure and deploy virtual machines that fit your needs. Each vir-\ntual machine you create (sometimes referred to as spin up ) is called an instance , and\nthe different configuration types available for these instances (such as CPU, memory,\nand storage) are called instance types .", "and storage) are called instance types . \n You can spin up as many or as few virtual machines as you need, each with granular\ncontrols so you can get exactly what you want. Because you are in essence \u201crenting\u201d\nthe compute resources from AWS, you do not have to invest in procuring hardware up\nfront, which saves time, money, and labor. \n67 4.1 Compute services\n The usage of Amazon EC2 is billed based on the following:\n\uf0a1Number of hours the instance is being utilized\n\uf0a1Size of the instance", "\uf0a1Size of the instance\n\uf0a1Region it is deployed in\n\uf0a1Type of operating system it uses\nThe service integrates very well with other AWS services (such as database services),\nwhich makes architecting an IT infrastructure in AWS much easier. For those of you\nwho want to get rolling quickly, AWS offers preconfigured templates for your Amazon\nEC2 instances called Amazon Machine Images  (AMIs). AMIs package settings you need to", "spin up a server, such as operating systems and software, so that you can configure and\ndeploy a virtual machine in just minutes. If you are so inclined, you can even create your\nown AMIs so you can quickly deploy resources with standardized configurations.\n One of the most prominent features of Amazon EC2 is its ability to auto scale. Scal-\ning is the process in which resources are procured when needs arise, as well as con-", "tract, or release, resources when they are no longer necessary. In IT jargon, people\nrefer to these types of flexible changes as \u201cscaling out, scaling in\u201d or \u201cscaling up, scal-\ning down.\u201d \n An example of a situation where scaling may be necessary is before a big annual\nsale for an online shop. You may be expecting 10 or even 100 times the regular visitor\ntraffic and purchases on your e-commerce website. With legacy IT infrastructure, you", "would have to purchase servers with this huge surge in mind. While purchasing the\nbuffed-up servers for this one event may help to prevent system overwhelm during the\none-week sale, the resources are wasted for the remainder of the year when the cus-\ntomer traffic is just a fraction of that during the sale period. \n Scaling up (increasing the resources to meet the surge in demand when the sale\noccurs) and then scaling back down (decreasing the resources when the sale is over so", "that resources and money are not wasted) allows a company to save money and time as\nit navigates fluxes in demand. Amazon EC2 makes this process even smoother by help-\ning achieve elasticity  through auto scaling. \n Elasticity and auto scaling allow your IT resources to automatically acquire\nresources as you need them and release them when they are no longer necessary. You\ncan imagine a rubber band stretching automatically when there\u2019s pressure to extend", "and then contracting back down when the pressure is no longer there. Rubber bands\ncan expand and contract because of elasticity, and auto-scaling IT resources work the\nsame way. Elasticity is part of the performance efficiency pillar of the AWS\u2019s Well-\nArchitected Framework we learned about in chapter 2.\n4.1.2 AWS Elastic Beanstalk\nPlant a seed and watch the beanstalk grow! AWS Elastic Beanstalk is a compute service", "that helps you upload your application code into the service (the seed); it automati-\ncally springs up the web application on AWS for you (the beanstalk), taking care of\ndetails such as resource provisioning, load balancing, auto scaling, and monitoring. \n68 CHAPTER  4Core AWS services\n OK, so I\u2019m reaching a little with the\nanalogy, but I hope you get my drift.

You can deploy your code through the\nAWS Management Console, Elastic Bean-\nstalk command-line interface, Visual Stu-", "stalk command-line interface, Visual Stu-\ndio, and Eclipse. You also have the option\nof controlling which AWS resources you want to use to power your web application (such\nas the instance type for Amazon EC2) and can take over any or all of the management\nof your IT infrastructure at any time.\n Great news! AWS Elastic Beanstalk is free to use.

As a cloud architect, you pick the\ntype of load balancer that most closely matches your needs to balance your web traffic\ntoward your compute resources. \nNOTE Interested in learning more about the different types of load balanc-\ners? Check out the developer guide for load balancer types here: http:/ / mng\n.bz/rnax .", ".bz/rnax .\nSome of the different services that ELB can work with are Amazon EC2, AWS Certifi-\ncate Manager, AWS Global Accelerator, and Amazon CloudWatch, among others.\nWith any partnership it has, ELB can improve the availability and scalability of your\napplications. Like Amazon EC2, you pay for what you use. The billing is calculated\nbased on the number of load-balancer units being utilized per hour and for each hour\n(or partial hour) of use.\n4.1.4 AWS Lambda", "(or partial hour) of use.\n4.1.4 AWS Lambda\nServerless services allow you to run code without the need to launch and maintain\nservers.

All the equipment is there for you, clean and prepped, and you simply need\nto show up with the ingredients (code) and cook (run the code). Currently, there are\na little over two dozen compute services in this specific service group. \n \n \n70 CHAPTER  4Core AWS services\n Want to run code but don\u2019t want to deal with the overhead tasks and responsibili-", "ties related to configuring and managing servers? AWS Lambda is the serverless com-\npute service for you! It is an event-driven compute service, which allows you to\n\u201ctrigger\u201d Lambda functions to run code for virtually any type of application or service.\nLambda functions are resources you can call on to run your code in AWS Lambda. \n You can think of lambda functions like recipes that you invoke when a restaurant", "customer orders a specific meal. The recipe is dormant in your mind until the order is\nput in, at which time you, as the cook, can spring into action, utilizing different\nresources (ingredients) in the kitchen to whip up the delicious meal. You can trigger\nAWS Lambda from over 200 AWS services and applications, which makes it a cost-\neffective way to design your web application infrastructure.\n Figure 4.2 shows an example workflow using AWS Lambda, where you utilize", "image processing to resize images upon upload. A user may upload a profile photo for\na social media application, which is uploaded to Amazon S3, a storage service. That\naction is set to trigger AWS Lambda to begin processing the images by running code\nto resize the images for different browser sizes (a lambda function). \nYou only need the code \u201cwaiting\u201d for the trigger (a new image uploaded by the user)\nfor it to complete its task instead of worrying about managing the backend infrastruc-", "ture. AWS Lambda can also automatically scale based on demand, so even if it gets an\ninflux of new users trying to upload new profile photos at the same time, it can pro-\ncess all of the requests in real time.\n You could spin up a virtual machine on Amazon EC2, pay for that, and spend some\ntime configuring and managing the virtual machine to run your code.

We have also learned about ELB and AWS Elastic Beanstalk, which are\ncategorized as cost and capacity management  services. AWS Lambda is a serverless type of\ncompute service. Now, we come to Amazon Elastic Container Service, or Amazon ECS,", "which, as you might have guessed from the name, belongs in the container  category of\ncompute services.\n First, we need to review what containers are. Containers provide a lightweight and\nconsistent way for developers to package and deploy applications. Developers can\npackage an application\u2019s code, configurations, and dependencies into a single object\n(container), creating an isolation of processes. Basically, containers allow developers", "to create packages (think of a container like a cardboard box) where they have every-\nthing they need \u201cinside\u201d to deploy an application. Having all the parts (like code) and\nconfigurations prepackaged means that the developer can just pick it up and deploy it\nin different environments.\n Amazon ECS is a fully managed container orchestration service that helps develop-\ners launch thousands of these containers on the AWS Cloud. Previously, you needed", "to install and operate your own container orchestration software, but with a fully man-\naged container orchestration service, you can easily run and scale containerized appli-\ncations, saving developers time, money, and labor. \n And like AWS Elastic Beanstalk, it\u2019s free to use!

Storage services , as the name suggests, help you store data\nin AWS. \n AWS offers storage for three types of data:\n\uf0a1Object storage\n\uf0a1File storage\n\uf0a1Block storage\n72 CHAPTER  4Core AWS services\nLet\u2019s take a moment to look at figure 4.3 to visualize the different types of cloud data\nstorage and compare them to types of storage we may be more familiar with on a daily\nbasis.\nObject storage may be the most difficult type of cloud storage to visualize. Files are", "broken down into pieces called objects , which are placed in buckets. Your real-life buck-\nets may store dirt for gardening, while these cloud buckets store data pieces (objects).\nObject storage allows you to store massive amounts of unstructured data. You store\nobjects such as photos or videos in Google Photos using object storage. Each object\nhas three components: the data itself, metadata (additional descriptive properties that", "help with indexing and management of data), and the identifier (address given to the\nunit of data so it can be located within the hard drive).\n Object storage is best suited for static data \u2014data that doesn\u2019t dynamically change\nor evolve\u2014because objects can\u2019t be modified once placed there. Because object stor-\nage utilizes a flat structure, you can scale to huge quantities of data. And thanks to the\nidentifiers and metadata embedded in each object, you or your application can find", "the data quickly regardless of how much data exists within the infrastructure. Amazon\nS3 is an example of an AWS service that utilizes object storage. \n File storage, on the other hand, is a lot easier to conceptualize: data is stored as\npieces of information inside a folder, like files within a folder on your laptop. Unlike\nobject storage, file storage has a hierarchy, and folders can be inside other folders. You", "must know the exact location of the piece of data you are looking for to find it, which\ncan be a long search if the piece of data is housed a few folders down the logical hier-\narchy. This is the file storage type we are most familiar with as we\u2019ve been using it for\ndecades when we store or access files in folders on our desktop computers. Amazon\nElastic File System (Amazon EFS) is an example of an AWS service utilizing file storage.", "Block storage stores data in units called blocks . Like object storage, block storage\nstores unique identifiers to each block so it can be retrieved from wherever it\u2019s being\nstored. Blocks of data are distributed among multiple environments, and when the\ndata is requested, the blocks are reassembled for the user. Generally, the system uti-\nlizes storage-area network environments, managed by a server. \nFile storage\nBlock storage\u201cBucket\u201d\nObject storageData\nMetadataIdentifier", "Object storageData\nMetadataIdentifier\nFigure 4.3 There are three \ntypes of storage for data in the \ncloud: object storage, stored in \nunits of buckets; file storage, \nstored in units of files; and \nblock storage, stored in units \nof blocks.\n73 4.2 Storage services\n In our daily lives, we utilize a similar concept to block storage when we use USB\nthumb or external hard drives. We save data onto these devices and can then connect", "these blocks of storage to whatever computer we wish to access everything we saved on\nthem. Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) is an example of an AWS service uti-\nlizing block storage. \n The core storage services we learn about in the next section are as follows:\n\uf0a1Amazon S3\n\uf0a1Amazon EBS\n\uf0a1AWS Snowball\n\uf0a1AWS Storage Gateway\n\uf0a1Amazon EFS\n4.2.1 Amazon Simple Storage Service\nAmazon Simple Storage Service, or Amazon S3, is one of the most widely utilized AWS", "services available. It is an object storage service that allows you to store a virtually limit-\nless amount of data for a wide variety of use cases and offers scalability, data availabil-\nity, security, and performance. As with many other core AWS services, Amazon S3\npartners well with other AWS services, allowing you to create a customized IT infra-\nstructure to suit your needs. Because it is an object storage service, you store data", "(objects) in buckets. Each object can be up to 5 TB (a terabyte is 1000 GB, which is\n1000 MB\u2014so pretty huge)!\n Amazon S3 has different storage classes for different needs and budgets, which\nmakes it an attractive choice for companies and people looking to store their data in\nAWS while being cognizant of their budgets. Each class is built for specific use cases, as\nwell as how often the data needs to be accessed.\n Currently, the available Amazon S3 storage classes are as follows:", "\uf0a1S3 Intelligent-Tiering\n\uf0a1S3 Standard\n\uf0a1S3 Standard-Infrequent Access\n\uf0a1S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access\n\uf0a1S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval\n\uf0a1S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval\n\uf0a1S3 Glacier Deep Archive\n\uf0a1S3 Outposts\nAmazon S3 also provides S3 Lifecycle configurations that help you configure how data\nis migrated from one storage class to another depending on the importance of data,\ntime, or how often the data needs to be retrieved. Moving from one storage class to a", "lower-cost storage class can save money, while the S3 Lifecycle policies automatically\nmake the transition for you based on predetermined triggers that save you time and\nlabor.\n74 CHAPTER  4Core AWS services\nAMAZON  S3 G LACIER\nThe different storage classes for Amazon S3 provide users with various price points for\ndifferent uses and access frequencies. While storage classes such as Amazon S3 Stan-\ndard are used for data that may require rather frequent access, the Amazon S3 Glacier", "series of classes are positioned to store data for longer periods. Amazon S3 Glacier\nprovides extremely low-cost, secure, and highly durable data storage, often utilized for\ndata archiving and backup. For cost-effective long-term storage, you can use the Ama-\nzon S3 Glacier classes, such as S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval, instead of the higher\npriced but potentially more easily accessible classes of S3 storage.\n4.2.2 Amazon Elastic Block Store", "4.2.2 Amazon Elastic Block Store\nAmazon Elastic Block Store, or Amazon EBS, as the name suggests, is a block storage\nservice that provides block-level storage volumes to use with Amazon EC2 instances.\nConceptually, it is similar to how you use an external hard drive (Amazon EBS) with\nyour desktop computer (Amazon EC2). \n While Amazon EBS is utilized with Amazon EC2 instances, it can exist on its own\nwithout being attached to EC2 instances. EBS volumes behave like raw, unformatted", "block devices and are chameleons of sorts. You can utilize Amazon EBS in a variety of\nways such as creating a file system on top of these volumes or simply as a block device\n(think: external hard drives).

As we learn throughout this chapter, keeping your cloud-based IT infrastruc-\nture secure and compliant is a shared responsibility between you (the customer) and\nthe cloud computing platform.\n When you decide to use AWS as your cloud computing platform, you can benefit\nfrom the dozens of compliance programs embedded into the platform to keep your", "data safe and meet your industry\u2019s and country\u2019s data security compliance require-\nments.

Consider how you might use each tool to get", "some valuable information that will allow you and your organization to make effective\nbusiness decisions. Let\u2019s get started!\n6.1.1 Types of AWS pricing models\nOne of the biggest benefits to utilizing AWS and cloud computing in general is that\ncloud computing offers a pay-as-you-go pricing model as opposed to the pay-full-price-\nbefore-you-use model we\u2019re used to with legacy on-premises (on-site) IT infrastructure", "purchases. As we discussed earlier, you can think of the AWS payment system like your\nmonthly utility bills for water and electricity.\n Rather than paying $2500 up front for that MacBook Pro, you can spin up a virtual\nmachine on AWS and pay monthly usage fees for the resources you consumed, for as\nlong as you use them. When you no longer need the service, you can shut it down, and\nyou are no longer charged. While that seems simple enough, there is actually a bit", "more granularity in how AWS pricing works, which you need to know before spinning\nup different AWS services. Let\u2019s take a look.\nFUNDAMENTALS  OF AWS PRICING\nDepending on the services you are utilizing, they may be billed differently. Some\nexamples are per GB of storage with Amazon Simple Cloud Storage (Amazon S3) and\nper hour of use with Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2). You can check\nout the different ways services are priced by scrolling to Services Pricing on the AWS", "Pricing page ( https:/ / aws.amazon.com/pricing/ ) and clicking the desired service cat-\negory. As illustrated in figure 6.1, the fundamental drivers of cost with AWS (how you\nare charged for utilizing AWS) are as follows:\n103 6.1 AWS billing and pricing concepts\n\uf0a1Compute\n\uf0a1Storage\n\uf0a1Outbound data transfer (inbound data transfer is generally free)\nNOTE Another great resource is an AWS white paper titled \u201cHow AWS Pricing\nWorks: AWS Pricing Overview,\u201d which can be viewed at http:/ / mng.bz/RvER .", "AWS\u2019 S PRICING  MODELS\nAWS also has several pricing models that incentivize planning in advance and consum-\ning more resources. Including the pay-as-you-go model we\u2019ve already discussed, AWS\u2019s\npricing models are as follows:\n\uf0a1Pay as you go (on-demand pricing) \u2014This is the most flexible pricing plan: you\nonly pay for what you use without overcommitting budgets, and it is responsive\nto granular changes in requirements.", "to granular changes in requirements.\n\uf0a1Save when you commit (reserved instances) \u2014Utilize savings plans by committing to\nusing a specific amount of an AWS service or category of services for a one- or\nthree-year period.\n\uf0a1Take advantage of unused AWS capacity (spot instances) \u2014Receive huge discounts\ncompared to on-demand pricing when you use unutilized AWS capacity (Ama-\nzon EC2 spot instances are up to 90% off on-demand pricing!).", "\uf0a1Pay less by using more \u2014Receive volume discounts as your usage increases with\ntiered pricing for certain services (generally requires a lot of resource use).\nBy mixing and matching these different pricing models with your organization\u2019s spe-\ncific needs, you can get the most bang for your buck while retaining flexibility and\nresponsiveness in critical areas. \n As a quick example, you may choose to spin up your virtual servers on Amazon", "EC2 with pay-as-you-go pricing for new projects. You are still scoping out your needs\nand want to retain flexibility, so you go with on-demand pricing. However, you decide\nto commit to a certain amount of Amazon S3 storage for 1- and 3-year periods for stor-\ning backups.
