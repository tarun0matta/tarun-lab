In all major releases of the R/3 System, there have been enhancements\nto the Warehouse Management application. In 2004, for Release 4.7 Extension\nSet 2.0 SAP released a group of enhancements for warehouse management that\nwere collectively called \u0093ERP Extended Warehouse Management\u0094. This group ofenhancements are add-on f unctions to the warehouse management system and include\nthe functions: yard management, cross-docking and value added services. The ERPExtended Warehouse Management enhancements have no relationship to the ExtendedWarehouse Management system that was released in 2005 by SAP.\nIn 2005, SAP announced the availability of its Service Parts Management (SPM)\nSystem. Extended Warehouse Management ( EWM) was an integral component of this\nsystem. However, today, EWM is considered a standalone application that can be used\nin any warehousing environment and it does not require any connection to SPM.\nSAP has further enhanced EWM since it's", "an integral component of this\nsystem. However, today, EWM is considered a standalone application that can be used\nin any warehousing environment and it does not require any connection to SPM.\nSAP has further enhanced EWM since it's introduction.

The introduction of the SAP Extended Warehouse Management System\ndoes not mean that it replaces the SAP WM system. It just means that there is now an\nadditional alternative for those warehouse s that require the functionality provided by\nEWM. An S AP customer can implement the SAP WM system for some warehouses\nand EWM for other warehouses in its enterpri se. One of the main differences between\nthe SAP WM system and the SAP EWM system is that functionally, the WM systemin more \u0093inward\u0094 focused. In general, there is very little functionality that provides a\nlink to external processes such as transpor tation cross-docking, contract packaging\nand transportation.\n4 \u00a9 2008 SAP AG.

It was designed to be a fully\ndecentralized WM system. Shown in the figure below, EWM is an application within\nthe SCM 2007 server environment that incl udes other applications, principally,\nAdvanced Planning and Optimization.\nFigure 6: Landscape Overview - Decentralized EWM\nAlthough EWM shares the same server as the other applications such as APO andEvent M anagement, it is a standalone application. In fact, if due to performance\nconsiderations, EWM can be run in its ow n server environment. SAP recommends\nt h a tE W Mn o tr u ni nt h es a m es e r v e ra sap l a n n i n ga p p l i c a t i o ns u c ha st h eA P ODemand planning and Production Planning/Detail Scheduling.\nAlthou gh EWM is a self-contained ap plication, it does require integration with an ERP\nsystem for master and transaction data. We will cover the master data requirements\nin a subsequent unit. Certain functions in EWM such as Kit-to-stock, slotting andavail ability checking require an interface to ot her SAP applications/systems such as\nC R M ,G l o b a lA T Pi nA P Oa n dS e r v i c eP a r t sP l a n n i n gi nA P O .\nIn the SCM 2007 release of EWM, the ability to run EWM in a centralized mode\nwithin the SAP ECC 6.0 became available. In addition, EWM can be supported from\nthe SA P R/3 4.6C through the ECC 5.0 release s with the application of Service pack\n06 (SP06).\n8 \u00a9 2008 SAP AG.

This data transfer is designed to occur in\nreal-time. Document data transfer is a two -way process. Delivery document data can\nbe transferred from the ERP system to the EWM", "a two -way process. Delivery document data can\nbe transferred from the ERP system to the EWM system for processing and updates to\nthe delivery documents can be transferred from EWM to the ERP system.\nMaster data required by the EWM system is handled in a different manner. Master\ndata to be transferred to EWM is processed though the use of the APO Core interface\n(the \u0093CIF\u0094). The process of moving master data (material, customer and vendor)requires the creation of integration models. Integration models contain the parameters\nthat specify what master data to transfer. T he model, after creation, is activated.\nThis activation process causes the master data to be physically transferred to theEWM system. Included in the process of establishing the CIF models are settings\nthat determine how subsequent relevant ma ster data is transferred (for example,\nin real time or subsequent delta updates). The master data transfer of data is in\nuni-directional. From the ERP system to the EWM system.

When you implement EWM, you define the\nindividual physical areas within the ware house such as high-rack storage area, bulk\nstorage area, picking storage area, and so on as storage types within a warehousecomplex, and join them together under one warehouse number. In EWM, you define\nstorage bins for each storage type.

All storage\nbins with specific common attributes bel ong to one storage section. For example,\nstorage bins for fast moving items that are close to the goods issue zone.\n\u0095 Storage bin - Each storage type and storage s ection consists of a selection of\nstorage compartments that are called storage bins in EWM. The coordinates of\nthe storage bin tell you the exact pos ition in the warehouse, where you can\nstore products. Storage bins are considered master data and will be covered\nin a subsequent unit.\n\u0095 Quant - The quant is used for inventory management of a product in a storage\nbin. A quant represents a quantity of a p roduct assigned to a storage bin. The\nquant is not organizational data and will be covered in detail in a subsequent unit.\n\u0095 Activity area - An activity area is a logical grouping of storage bins. It can\nrefer to a storage bin, or can concatenate bins from several storage types. Youcan either assign storage bins manually to the activity areas, or if there is a 1:1\nrelationship between storage type and activity area, you can have the system\ngenerate the assignment.\nWarehouse Number\nThe organizational and phys ical attributes of a warehouse complex are entered under\nthe warehouse number in customizing. Fo r example, the weight unit, volume unit,\nand time unit of measure are defined at th e warehouse number level.

There are,however, functions within EWM that allow y ou to download storage bin master data\nfrom a legacy/external system when implementing EWM. Another example of EWMinternal master data is pack aging specifications. Packaging specifications must be\ncreated within the EWM system.\nIn summary, the objective of this lesson is to familiarize you with the required EWM\nmaster data, how it is created and maintained within the EWM system.\nLesson Objectives\nAfter completing this lesson, you will be able to:\n\u0095 Describe the master data that is required within the EWM system\n\u0095 Outline the technique used to get the EWM required location and material master\ndata from the ERP system to the EWM system.\n\u0095 Create and maintain storage bins in EWM\u0095 Outline the purpose of packaging specifications in EWM\u0095 Create packaging specifications within EWM\n48 \u00a9 2008 SAP AG.

In fact, an EWM warehouse can, though\ncustomizing, be assigned a default Par ty Entitled to Dispose. An EWM warehouse can\nalso be assigned in EWM customizing a Custodian business partner. The Custodian\npartner is a location that manages the warehouse products but does not hold title tothe goods.

The storage bin is the\nsmallest spatial unit in a warehouse. Therefore, the storage bin represents the exact\nposition in the warehouse where products can be stored. Since the address of a storage\nbin is frequently derived from a coordinate system, a storage bin is often referred to as\na coordinate. For example, the coordinate 01-02-03 could be a storage bin in aisle 1,\nstack 2, and level 3. In EWM the bin coordinate is 18 characters in length.\nIn customizing you define the bin coordinate structure by assigning, first of all, a\nunique character to represent the following components of the bin coordinate:\n\u0095 Aisle\n\u0095S t a c k\n\u0095 Level\u0095 Bin subdivision\n\u0095B i n D e p t h\nYou can then use this coding to create templates that can be used to generate the\nstorage bin master data automatically.\nTo each storage bin, you assign the warehouse number in which the storage bin\nis located. You must also assign a storage type and storage section to each storage\nbin. It is important to note that the bin coordinate assigned to a storage bin must beunique within the warehouse. You can also define the following additional attributesfor a storage bin:\n\u0095 Storage bin type - used to indicate relative size of bin and/or actual bin\ndimensions\n\u0095 Bin Access Type - used to control how bin is accessed by resources\n\u0095 RF Verification field - used to store the b i", "bin:\n\u0095 Storage bin type - used to indicate relative size of bin and/or actual bin\ndimensions\n\u0095 Bin Access Type - used to control how bin is accessed by resources\n\u0095 RF Verification field - used to store the b i nc o o r d i n a t e - r e l a t e dd a t au s e di nR F\nscanning to verify that the correct bin is being accessed\n\u0095 Geo-coordinates of storage bin - used by EWM to compute distances between\nthe bins in goods movements\n\u0095 Capacity checking attributes (max weight, volume, total capacity) - used to\ncontrol the amount of product assigned to a bin.\n\u0095 Fire containment section - used in product hazardous material reporting\nYou can use any combination of letters and numbers for storage bin coordinates.\nHowever, you should ensure that you orient th e parts of the structure to the indicators\ndefined for the warehouse for aisle, stack, level, and so on.\nAs described earlier, storage bins are assi gned to Activity Areas to facilitate physical\nbin access by warehouse activities such as picking, putaway, physical inventory\ncounting and replenishment.

The packaging specification is used to define the packing\nrequirements for products to be put away or transported.\nWithin Extended Warehouse Management the packing process, using packaging\nspecifications, can be perform ed in the following processes:\n\u0095 Packing in the work center (pack ing station or deconsolidation)\n\u0095 Automatic packing in inbound delivery processing\n\u0095 Packing during warehouse task confirmation\n\u0095 Deconsolidation using the RF framework\u0095 Packing using the RF framework\nOne common use of packaging specifications is to specify how products are palletized.\nThe palletization of a product can influenc e how the material is assigned to storage\nbins during the putaway process. For example, in your warehouse, you put away\nproduct A onto pallets for 50 pieces. You wou ld create a packaging specification with\na level that contains the main packaging material, Pallet, and the contents Product A.For this level, enter the target quantity 50. In the process \u0091Putaway\u0092 for the inbounddelivery, the system splits the quantity in the inbound delivery across multiple\nwarehouse tasks, due to this packaging spe cification. For example, if a quantity of\n100 pieces is delivered, then the system creates two warehouse tasks for 50 pieces.\nA document, the packaging specification", ", due to this packaging spe cification. For example, if a quantity of\n100 pieces is delivered, then the system creates two warehouse tasks for 50 pieces.\nA document, the packaging specification defines all the necessary packing levels for a\nproduct and the related packaging materials.

Similar information related to\nthe packaging materials and auxiliary packaging materials are also retained in the\nhandling unit structures.

There are three\nlevels of h andling units in the example. The \u0093p ackages\u0094 represent the first level.\nThe \u0093package\u0094 HU's were then packed to a pallet packaging material creating thesecond level handling units. The \u0093palle t\u0094 HU's were then packed to a packaging\nmaterial that represents the vehicle, or means o f transport, which gives us our third\nand highest level handling unit.\nWithin EWM, whether products are required to be processed in handling units\ndepends on a number of factors. If the use of handling units is an enterprise standardthen pro ducts will normally be received, WM-managed and issued in handling unit\nform. Even in warehouses where products are not managed in handling unit form,certain EWM processes will require that products being received or issued be packedinto han dling units, at least temporarily, to facilitate the internal EWM processes. In\nEWM, in the putaway process, for example , products may be HU-managed until they\nare actually putaway in their final bin. Wh en the actual putaway occurs to the final\nbin, th e HU number can be removed by the system from the product.\nProduc ts can only be placed into storage bins within a storage type that has been\nconfigured to allow handling units. In EWM customizing of Storage Types, youindicate whether HU's can be placed into bins in the storage type, or whether only\nHU's c an be placed in the storage type, or you can forbid HU's from being placed into\na storage type. If a product is putaway in EWM in handling unit form, the HU data istransferred to the ERP system during the goods receipt posting and is visible there.\nIn the Yard Management, Transportation Cross Docking and Transportation functions\nwithi n EWM, handling units are created intern ally by EWM to represent the vehicles\nand their loads.\n2008 \u00a9 2008 SAP AG.

GUI (MS Windows-based) devices are connected to the SAP\nSystem just like any other client-dependent PC. The screens can be touch screens,\nusing predefined pushbuttons, or they c an be operated using a keyboard. If you are\nusing touch screens, you simply \"touch\" the appropriate positions on the touch screen\ninstead of clicking with the mouse on a pushbutton.\nCharacter-based devices are linked to the system through SAPConsole. SAPConsole\noperates on a Windows NT/Windows 2000/X P platform and interacts with the RF\nterminals connected to it. This concept is currently supported by the leading providers\nof RF terminals. The system uses the I TSMobile for connecting browser-based\nor Windows CE devices. ITSMobile replaces the previous graphical interface\nWebSAPConsole. WebSAPConsole will no longer be functional beginning with\nNetWeaver 7.1.\nAll screen forms use a common format as illustrated below.\nFigure 37: Basic Screen layouts\nThe RF framework supports the use of bar codes for identification and verification\npurpo ses. SAP currently supports EAN 128 bar code types, but you can also support\nother types within the RF framework throug h customizing in the Mobile Data Entry\nactivity.\n2008 \u00a9 2008 SAP AG.

EWM works with both inactive\nand active document versions. In EWM war ehouse tasks are created to fulfill the\nwarehouse requests. You can create, process, delete, or archive warehouse requests.In the goods receipt process, the Inbound Delivery document is the warehouse\nrequest. The inbound delivery warehouse re quest document defines, logically, a work\nlist for EWM that determines the put away of the goods being received. EWM uses\nthe warehouse request document, the inbou nd delivery, to create the warehouse tasks\nfor putaway. Also, EWM executes the posting of goods movements for the goodsreceipts based on the warehouse request. E WM uses the inbound delivery notification,\nwhich is the message from the SAP ERP system to create the warehouse request\nfor an inbound delivery.\nWhen an inbound delivery", "WM executes the posting of goods movements for the goodsreceipts based on the warehouse request.

EWM automatically creates handling units according to\nthe packing instruction. It uses the condition technique to do this.\n\u0095 Connection to SAP Business Information Warehouse . When a delivery item\nhas been completed in EWM, EWM sends the current data to SAP BusinessInformation Warehouse. A prerequisite for this is that you must have activated\nthe update of delivery items in SA P Business Information Warehouse.\n\u0095 If no packaging specification exists for the packing of products during goods", "data to SAP BusinessInformation Warehouse. A prerequisite for this is that you must have activated\nthe update of delivery items in SA P Business Information Warehouse.\n\u0095 If no packaging specification exists for the packing of products during goods\nreceipt, EWM can automatically trigger a WebFlow or SAP Alert Framework to\nnotify someone.\n\u0095 Review of the handling unit type for notified handling units. During creation\nof an inbound delivery with a correspondi ng handling unit, de livery processing\nchecks whether the handling unit is permissible for the warehouse.\n\u0095 Creation of batches.\n\u0095 Goods receipt posting. If EWM automatically creates a delivery based on a\nwarehouse request from ERP, you can ca rry out partial goods receipt postings\nusing the warehouse task confirmation. When you confirm a warehouse task,\nEWM automatically executes a corresponding partial goods receipt posting. It\nreports this to ERP. With the delivery UI, you can either post the goods receipt\nfor individual handling units only , or you can post it completely.\nActive and Inactive Document Versions\nExtended Warehouse Management (EWM) can accept or reject change messages for\ninbound deliveries from the ERP system. EWM uses inactive and active document\nversions for this. If warehouse activitie s (follow-on activities) have already begun\nfor inbound deliveries, EWM rejects change messages from the ERP system. Forexample, EWM has already created a warehouse task (WT) for an inbound delivery.In doing so, EWM has also already set the status type Warehouse Activities to the\nstatus value Partially Completed.

The\nwarehouse order consists of warehouse tasks or physical inventory items.\nWhen products are received, issued, moved or counted warehouse tasks are created.\nThe warehouse tasks are grouped together into warehouse orders and EWM makes\nthem available for processing. For example, in the goods receiving process,\nwarehouse tasks are created to move the products into the warehouse and to theirdestination storage bin.

The warehouse order creation\nrules (WOCR's) are defined in Customizing.\nWarehouse Order Creation\nWarehouse order creation groups together warehouse tasks into warehouse orders,according to settings in Customizing for warehouse orders, and thus creates optimumwork packages for the warehouse. For ware house order creation, rules are defined\nwith their relevant criteria. Warehouse order creation is particularly suitable foroptimizing processes for putaway and picking.\nAn inbound delivery can contain a number of products to be received into the\nwarehouse. Some products in the goods receipt might be subject to certain EWM\nprocesses such as deconsolidation and quality inspections; whereas, other might\nsimple be assigned to a destination storage bin for a direct putaway. After EWM\ncreates the warehouse tasks for the produ cts, the system joins tasks together into\nwarehouse orders according to the configured warehouse order creation rules.

For example, goods\nreceipt from production does not include creation of an inbound delivery in the\nstandard process. Another common example, is that goods arrive in a shipment that\nwere not in the advanced shipping notification (ASN) sent by the vendor. Use of theexpected goods receipts function will pr ovide solutions to these problems.\nLesson Objectives\nAfter completing this lesson, you will be able to:\n\u0095 Understand the use of the expected goods receipts processes in receiving from\npurchase orders and production orders\n\u0095 Describe the use of the Notification of Expected Goods Receipt and Expected\nGoods Receipt documents.\n\u0095 Generate and Delete Expected Goods Receipts.\n\u0095 Generate Inbound Delivery documents from Expected Goods Receipt documents.\nBusiness Example\nAt IDES, AG, shipments, at times, arrive with products that are not in the inbound\ndelivery document created from the ASN sent by the vendor.

You use Business Add-Ins (BAdIs)\n/SCWM/EX_DLV_ERP_CALL and /SCWM/EX_DLV_ERP_CALL_CTRL to\ndefine whether you generate an inbound delivery in ERP or locally in EWM.\n\u0095 You can use the user interface for the inbound delivery in EWM, and specify\nthe required delivery data without ERP checking this data with the data of\nthe open purchase order. If you are not using any inbound deliveries in theproduction for your delivered products, the following options are available to\nyou for generating an inbound delivery:\n\u0096 You generate an expected goods receipt as a template document locally in\nEWM, which you can use to generate an inbound delivery manually.\n\u0096 In EWM, you choose the user interface for the inbound delivery, and\nspecify the required delivery data.\nIf an expected goods receipt is being used to generate an inbound delivery manually\nfor a purchase order or production order, this process has the following advantages:\n\u0095 Execution of the goods receipt process steps occurs in one system only, EWM.\n\u0095 If ERP is temporarily unavailable, you can still execute the goods receipt process\nsteps.\n\u0095 You generate an inbound delivery whose data has been checked by both ERP and\nEWM. This enables you to make sure that you post goods receipt in ERP as well.\n\u0095 Since the expected goods receipt is based on the data of the open purchase order\nor open production order, you can use the expected goods receipt as a preview\nof the goods receipt.\nIllustrated below is how the GR process in EWM could use the EGR data as part of\nthe product check-in process.\n176 \u00a9 2008 SAP AG.

Information related to the tagge d products such as pro duct identification,\nquantit y, descriptive information is electr onically embedded in the tags. This is\nin contrast to bar-coded labels in which information is printed in a coded, machinereadable form.\nUnlike bar code technology, RFID technology is designed, in general, to make\nunsupe rvised reading possible. And, RFID technology allows multiple tags to be\nread at the same time; whereas, bar code scanning generally requires each item to\nbe scanned individually.\nThere are two types of tags:\n\u0095 Passive tags. They carry no on-board power, but derive it from the radio waves\nemitte d by a reader.\n\u0095 Active tags. They have an on-board power source and have a longer\ncommunication range, and, generally, m ore memory. But, they have a higher\ncost.\nThe rea ch of RFID signals depends on the kind of chip, the frequency, etc. Passive\ntags normally have a range of less than 10 meters; whereas, active tags can have ranges\n> 10 meters.

This\nrequirement/demand data can also be used when slotting is used to relocate products\nbased on whether they are \u0093fast\u0094 or \u0093slow\u0094 moving. This requirement/demanddata can come from SAP Advanced Planni ng and Optimization (APO). Extended\nWarehouse Management (EWM) stores this in formation locally in the product master\n(on the Slotting tab page, Requi rement/Demand Data area).\nYou can also fill these local attributes in EWM with data from other sources. To dothis, you have several processing options in the product master, for example, manual\ninput or mass maintenance.\nA consideration when using APO planning data: APO and EWM manage requirement\ndata at different organizational levels. APO performs planning processes for locationsof the type Plant. EWM stores requirement data at warehouse number level. Slotting\nassumes that a 1:1 relationship exists between the SAP APO location and the EWMwarehouse number. If the relationship i s not 1:1, you can use Business Add-Ins\n(BAdIs) for the conversion.\nSlotting Process\nThe overall slotting process can be seen in the figure below.\nFigure 73: Slotting Process\n202 \u00a9 2008 SAP AG.

Then, using the co ndition technique as the primary driver,\nthe indicators are determined and stored in the warehouse product master.\nAll the product attributes that form the slotting results exist twice in the product master:\n\u0095 A sa c t i v ev a l u e s\n\u0095 As planned values (can be recognized due to their name)\nThe exact values that are updated when the results are updated depends on the save\nmode that you chose wh en you called slotting.\nT h es a v eo p t i o n sa r ea sf o l l o w s :\n\u0095 Do Not Save Results - It is recommended that you use this option if you have\nperformed slotting interactively and yo u want to analyze the results. If you have\nperformed slotting in the background, yo u can analyze the log, but you cannot\nsee the results directly.\n\u0095 Save Results - (The system only updates the planned values in the product\nmaster.) Depending on the storage bin and stock situations, it can be useful\nto save the results of slotting as planned values only. The system only keeps\nthe planned values for a possible activ ation, and does not use them in storage\nprocesses.\n\u0095 Save and Activate Results - (The system updates both the planned values and\nthe active values in the product master.) The system updates the results of slotting\nin the fields for the planned values and t he active values in the product master.\nThese new values are then available immediately for all storage processes.\nRearrangement\nRearrangement: allows you to optimize space in a warehouse by moving stock to\noptimal locations. Rearrangement is based o n slotting. Slotting allows you to evaluate\nthe degree of optimality of a material in a location.\nIn rearrangement, the system compares th e current storage type, storage section,\nand storage bin type with the optimal para meters from slotting. When doing this, it\nanalyzes how well suited the current parameters (storage type, storage section, and\nstorage bin type) are to the product. If they are not optimal, the system proposes\nan optimum storage bin.\nIn the following illustrations the process of rearrangement is illustrated. The first\nfigure shows the warehouse before rearra ngement takes place. The warehouse has an\narea for fast-moving items (golden zone). It is positioned along the central aisle of\nthe warehouse to ensure that the picker can reach it easily. The area for slow-moving\nitems is positioned behind this area.\n2008 \u00a9 2008 SAP AG.

The key business partners are the\nsold-to, ship-to, bill-to and payer. These four business partner types are required in\nevery sales document.\nThe outbound business process also includes processing stock transport orders that\ndirect the movement of materials from one warehouse to another. In this process, thesource document for the shipping process is not a sales order but a stock transport\norder that is created in the purchasing application.\nThe Shipping Process\nThe shipping process begins when outbound delivery documents are created. Aselection is made from either sales documents or stock transport order documents to\ncreate a group of corresponding outbound delivery documents. There are two keypieces of information that are required in this selection process: the shipping point\nand a selection date. Each line item in a sales order and stock transport order has ashipping point determined for it. The shipping point represents a shipping group ora type of shipping (express, export, standar d, etc.) within the plant assigned to the\nmaterial item in the source document.

The results of the backward/forward scheduling\nprocess are stored in the schedule lines of the sales document.\nIn the outbound delivery crea tion process, the selection date used in concert with the\nshipping point selection data, causes the system to an create outbound delivery for all\nline i tems within a sales document that have a match on the shipping point and whose\nschedule line relevant dates are less than or equal to the selection date. The systemuses the earlier of the material availability date or the transportation planning date in\nthe se lection process.

This is generally based on delivery processing related to creation of sales\norders within the SAP CRM application. For performance reasons, CRM can be\nconfigured to suppress the replication of sales documents to the ERP system but create\nan unchecked delivery in the ERP system.\nThis business process is particularly useful when you have to process a large order\nvolume. It allows you to process many sales orders, which may contain multipleitems, more quickly and efficiently. Amo ngst other things, you can still change the\nquantities, ship-to party or location as long as the unchecked deliveries have not beenconverted into checked deliveries. In normal sales order processing, in which data", ", more quickly and efficiently. Amo ngst other things, you can still change the\nquantities, ship-to party or location as long as the unchecked deliveries have not beenconverted into checked deliveries. In normal sales order processing, in which data isreplicated in SAP CRM and SAP ERP, this is not possible. Here, the order items are\nlocked and can no longer be changed once de livery has been triggered. Additionally,\nthis can improve system performance, as it is not negatively affected by system-wide\nlocking of sales orders.\nThe reduced scope of checks for an unch ecked delivery refers mainly to the\navailability check, but may also involv e other checks. An unchecked delivery\ncan be converted to a delivery with a document status of \u0093checked\u0094, which can be\nused for subsequent functions such as picking, packing or posting goods issue. An\nunchecked delivery is only created when the document to which it refers reflects\nshipping requirements (meaning that it c ontains an open confirmed quantity). In\n2008 \u00a9 2008 SAP AG.

The checked delivery can be processed without any restrictions. Both\noutbound deliveries that are created with re spect to preceding documents located in\nthe same system, and inbound deliveries, are c reated as checked deliveries because all\nthe delivery checks have been completed during creation.\nUnchecked deliveries that have been converted in the ERP system to checked\ndeliveries , or outbound deliveries created in ERP from sales documents that are\nrelevant for processing in an EWM ware house will be replicated to EWM as an\nOutbound Delivery Request document. The outbound delivery request is a document\ncontaining all the relevant logistics data in the outbound delivery process right from\nthe origin of the outbound delivery process (sales order, for example).\nThe", "to EWM as an\nOutbound Delivery Request document. The outbound delivery request is a document\ncontaining all the relevant logistics data in the outbound delivery process right from\nthe origin of the outbound delivery process (sales order, for example).\nThe outbound delivery request (ODR) is used to save the transferred data from a\nreference document in order to create an Outbound Delivery Order (ODO). Using the\noutbound delivery request, you can also process or reject incoming changes to an\nexisting outbound delivery order. The delivery process receives a message from a\nreference document in ERP with all the rele vant logistics data. An outbound delivery\nrequest is created automatically as a result of this message. The delivery process saves\nthe information from the message in the outbound delivery request. The message itselfis not saved. An Outbound Delivery Order (ODO) is created automatically from\nthe outbound delivery request.\nThe outbound delivery order is a document containing all the data required for\ntriggering and monitoring the complete outbound delivery process. This process starts\nwith the first planning activities for the outbound delivery and continues until the\nfinished goods have been loaded and sent. You either use the outbound delivery orderto preview the planning of pending warehouse activities or to execute the actions\nrequired to create the delivery. The outb ound delivery order is the warehouse request\ndocument for goods issue. You can use the outbound delivery order to execute the\nfollowing actions:\n\u0095 Creating the delivery and therefore creating an outbound delivery\n\u0095 Picking the delivery\n\u0095 Canceling the \u0093delivery picking\u0094\u0095 Loading the delivery\n\u0095 Canceling the \u0093delivery loading\u0094\n\u0095 Setting the status Leave Yard\u0095 Adjusting the delivery quantity to the picked quantity\n\u0095 Posting a goods movement\n\u0095 Canceling a goods movement\u0095 Creating and deleting items\n238 \u00a9 2008 SAP AG.

The\noutbound delivery is a document representing the goods to be delivered together to a\ngoods recipient. The outbound delivery is used as the basis for printing the delivery\nnote or for sending a shipping notifica tion. You can execute the following actions\nusing this document:\n\u0095 Posting a goods movement\n\u0095 Canceling a goods movement\n\u0095 Setting the status Leave Yard\nFor export related goods issues, the outbound delivery might be created before the GI\nposting in EWM.

In other cases the outbou nd delivery will automatically be created\nwith the GI posting for the Outbound Delivery Order in EWM. You can save, process,delete and archive an outbound delivery. To create an outbound delivery you canselect the action Create Outbound Delivery in the outbound delivery order.\nWarehouse Request\nAs mentioned earlier, the outbound deliv ery order (ODO) serves as the warehouse\nrequest document for goods issue processes. This warehouse request defines a work\nlist for Extended Warehouse Manageme nt (EWM) that indicates a goods pick.\nThe warehouse request for an outbound delivery order serves in EWM as basis for\nthe execution of picking activities. For e xample, EWM uses a warehouse request to\ncreate warehouse tasks for picking. As well, EWM executes the posting of goods\nmovements for the goods issue based on the warehouse request.\nAt the same time as an outbound delivery is generated in ERP, ERP sends a\nmessage for an outbound delivery request or posting change request to EWM. EWMautomatically generates a warehouse request (the outbound delivery order) using\nthe Post Processing Framework (PPF). During automatic creation and saving of the\noutbound delivery order, EWM triggers the following:\n\u0095 Mapping of delivery data from ERP onto the EWM delivery data\n\u0095 Data enrichment using data from EWM Customizing\n\u0095 Wave assignment, depending on your Customizing\n\u0095 Determination of Warehouse Process Type , which controls the processing of a\nw a r e h o u s et a s ki nE W M ,s u c ha sw h e t h er EWM is to immediately confirm a\nwarehouse task\n\u0095 Automatic packing - EWM automatically creates handling units according to the\npackaging specifications. The condition t echnique is used to make the packaging\nspecification determination. You can assign handling units and cross-delivery\nhandling units to an outbound delivery order. ERP copies this information to thecorresponding ERP outbound delivery.\n2008 \u00a9 2008 SAP AG.

As a prerequis ite, you must have activated the update of\ndelivery items in SAP Business Information Warehouse.\n\u0095 The additional functions that run automatically, or can be processed manually,\nwhen creating or changing an outbound delivery order, enables you to do the\nfollowing:\n\u0096 Rough determination of the picking l ocation - The system determines the\nsource storage bins for a delivery based on the stock removal strategies.\n\u0096 Determination of staging area\n\u0096 Determination of door assignment\u0096 Route determination\n\u0096 Adding packing items - If, for example, you use recyclable packing\nmaterials, you can manually add delivery items for the packing material\nto an outbound delivery order and then post goods issue again for this\npacking material.\n\u0096 You can control processes for outbound delivery orders as part of the\nconfiguration - For example, you can create an invoice before goods issuein the outbound delivery process. You can also do this on the basis of\nother delivery parameters, for example, the export relevance or the routethat is determined. As a prerequisite, y ou have defined process indicators\nfor the delivery document header and for the delivery document itemsin Customizing for EWM.\n\u0096 You can enter the account assignment on the user interface for the outbound\ndelivery order in the detail view of the item on the Account Assignments\ntab page. - For example, a department within your company requestsconsumable material from the warehouse. Inventory management is no\nlonger required for this consumable material. You update the consumable\nmaterial, for example, for a cost center or project, by entering the accountassignment on the user interface for the outbound delivery order.\nIf wave processing is being used, EWM creates the warehouse tasks at the same time\nas releasing the wave. Otherwise, wareho use tasks can be created directly from the\noutbound delivery order. In accordance with the warehouse task processing, EWM\ncreates warehouse orders to assemble work packages for the individual warehouse\nworkers.\n240 \u00a9 2008 SAP AG.

Extended\nWarehouse Management (EWM) sends the direct outbound delivery order to ERP.The direct outbound delivery order contains the ERP document number. The structure\nand data of the direct outbound delivery order match those of an outbound delivery\norder that is triggered in ERP. Direct outbound delivery orders can be used in thefollowing scenarios:\n\u0095 Customer Pickup at the warehouse\n\u0096 Direct sales - For direct sales, transportation activities do not apply,\nsince the customer asks for the goods and picks them up on-site at the\nwarehouse. You do not need to create a sales order for this. The directoutbound delivery order you generated manually in EWM forms the basis\nfor the delivery in ERP. The delivery in ERP forms the outbound document\nfor billing. You can also trigger dir ect sales in ERP without generating a\nsales order.\n\u0096 Account assignment - For account assignment, tr ansportation activities\nalso do not apply, since the internal or external customer asks for the goodsand picks them up on-site in the warehouse. Unlike direct sales, you post a\ngoods issue with account assignment for the goods, for the cost center, for\nexample. You can also trigger goods issue with account assignment in ERPwithout generating a sales order.\n\u0095 Scrapping - The direct outbound delivery order for scrapping forms the last step\nin the scrapping process. You post the goods to be scrapped with the goodsissue from the warehouse stock. Whereas, you can also trigger the preparation\nfor scrapping \u0096 such as collecting goo ds in a scrapping container \u0096 using a\nposting change request from ERP, you always trigger this last step locally in the\nwarehouse.\n\u0095 Kit to stock or reverse kitting - For kit to stock, you use a value-added service\norder to create a kit from different co mponents. If you want to reserve the\ncorresponding components, you can use a direct outbound delivery order. When\nyou have created the kit and posted goods issue for the direct", "delivery order. When\nyou have created the kit and posted goods issue for the direct outbound delivery\norder, EWM reduces the stock of the respective components.\nBecause direct delivery orders are created in EWM, EWM must trigger an availabilitycheck. Depending on the system configur ation, the check can be performed in ERP\nor SAP APO (gATP). Other external processes and checks may also have to beperformed. The following diagram illustrate s the potential external interfaces for\ndirect outbound delivery documents.\n2008 \u00a9 2008 SAP AG.

In SAP SCM 5.1, planning-related\nreservation of the products only takes place if you are using SAP Advanced\nPlanning and Optimization (SAP APO). No reservation takes place for checks in\nERP. In exceptional cases, over confirmation may occur.\n\u0095 A lot of organizational and logistically relevant delivery data that is copied to\noutbound delivery orders from ERP preceding documents must be specifiedfor the direct outbound delivery orders locally in EWM. Either the data is\nentered directly, such as the product o r quantity, or EWM determines the data\nautomatically using configuration data, such as the goods issue bin for items that\nare not pick-relevant.\n\u0095 Because no outbound delivery request from ERP exists for direct outbound\ndelivery orders, actions such as splittin g direct outbound delivery orders are not\npossible.

EWM then dete rmines by the default process code, or\nthe process code you enter through the function, \u0093quantity adjustment\u0094, that a new\ninbound is to be created for the remaining quantity.\nFor outbound delivery requests, a split may be necessary when the system has\ndetermined different routes for different items or due to the size, weight, or volume\nof the items in an outbound delivery order they will not fit on the same truck. For\noutbound delivery orders, split may be cr eated in the same way as inbound deliveries\nby changing the delivery quantity and usi ng a process code to generate a delivery\nfor the difference.\nIn general, if a delivery is split in", "outbound delivery orders, split may be cr eated in the same way as inbound deliveries\nby changing the delivery quantity and usi ng a process code to generate a delivery\nfor the difference.\nIn general, if a delivery is split in EWM, this also results in a split in ERP. The point in\ntime, when this split information is communi cated to ERP differs between inbound and\noutbound (e.g. outbound it is communicated at GI while in inbound it is communicatedearlier). Also, in outbound there can be multiple splits (e.g. ODR -> ODO -> OD) asthe split can be between ODR and ODO and also between ODO and OD.\nWarehouse Task\nA warehouse task for output processing i s a document that uses Extended Warehouse\nManagement (EWM) to execute goods issu e movements. Logical or physical goods\nmovements or even stock changes can be the basis for a warehouse task. You can\ncreate a warehouse task either with refe rence to a warehouse request such as the\noutbound deliver order, or without a refere nce document, for example for internal\ngoods movements.\nEach warehouse task is assigned a warehouse process type that among other functions,\nidentifies the task as either an inbound or outbound movement of product within the\nwarehouse. Just like inbound warehouse tasks, outbound tasks can be either product\nor handling unit tasks. In its basic form a warehouse task is a document that contains\nthe information about a product to be moved, the quantity to be moved and the source\nand destination location information related to the movement.\nWarehouse Order\nWhen products are to picked from the warehouse, warehouse tasks are created. ThenEWM groups these warehouse tasks together into warehouse orders, and makes them\navailable for processing.\n2008 \u00a9 2008 SAP AG.

One warehouse task is created that describes the route from source storage typeto an intermediate storage type. And ba sed on your settings in Customizing, the\nsystem g enerates one warehouse task from the intermediate storage type to the next\nintermediate storage type, or to the final destination storage type.\n2008 \u00a9 2008 SAP AG.

For example,\nwithin a stock removal process, at an intermediate storage type, you can distribute\nHUs containing different products to stoc k removal HUs. In combined stock removal,\nyou can determine the final destination sto rage type either at the beginning of the\nstock removal process, or later.\nEWM manages the intermediate storage types in the same way as standard storage\ntypes. For example, you the", "types. For example, you the storage types can have multiple sections and storage bins.\nProcess-Oriented Storage Control\nProcess-oriented storage control is used to map complex stock removal processes.Using this method of stroage control you can combine your storage process steps intoone storage process.

A process step\nin the outbound process could be one of the following:\n\u0095 PICK - the picking process\n\u0095 VAS (Value Added Services) - the picked product must go through some process\nto enhance it's value or meet some customer requirement (e.g. applying price\ntags, hangers, preservatives, etc.)\n\u0095 PACK - packaging of the picked product\n\u0095 STAGE - Stage the picked product for loading\n\u0095 LOAD - Load the product into its means of transport\nDepending on a product's processing re quirements it may be required, using\nprocess-oriented storage control to go through several process steps in the goods\nissue process.\nFigure 89: Outbound Processes\nAs illustrated above, process-oriented storage control can determine different pathsfor products depending on their processing requirements.\nIn the following illustration, process-orie nted storage control is illustrated for two\nproducts that are picked and must be packed together for shipment to the customer.\n2008 \u00a9 2008 SAP AG.

These waves,however, must be picked and processed at roughly the same time.\nA wave is a grouping of warehouse request items used to control the warehouse\nactivities such as picking or posting changes . These groupings are then processed\ntogether in subsequent processes. For exa mple, the transfer of all warehouse request\nitems assigned to a wave at a certain point in time to warehouse task creation.

In the illustration, wave processing combines the warehouse request items WR\nitem 10 and WR item 20 from warehouse request 100 and the warehouse request itemWR item 10 from warehouse request 200 into wave 1 on the basis of route A.\nWave Templates\nWarehouse request items are grouped into waves based on settings in a wave template.The wave template is considered master data in EWM. Wave templates serve as the\ninfrastructure for automatic wave assignment. They enable the same wave attributes to\nbe reused for different warehouse request items that comply with the same conditions.\nWave templates can be used to manually create waves, or", "in EWM. Wave templates serve as the\ninfrastructure for automatic wave assignment. They enable the same wave attributes to\nbe reused for different warehouse request items that comply with the same conditions.\nWave templates can be used to manually create waves, or, in the case of automaticwave assignment, to assign items or split items from the warehouse requests to\nexisting waves that are based on the wave templates. The wave template contains\nattributes that are used to determine what w arehouse request items are to be included\nin a wave. The following are examples of these attributes:\n\u0095 Release method with the possible values Automatic, Immediate, and Manual\n\u0095 Wave type that enables specific monitoring in the warehouse management\nmonitor\n\u0095 Wave category that you can use as a filter for warehouse order creation rules\n\u0095 Data for date and time related fields used to determine wave completion start and\ncompletion dates and times among others.\n\u0095 Capacity profile for d efining capacity limits\n\u0095 Calendar for defining workdays\nAfter the wave template is created it may be applied manually in manual wave creation\nor it can be determined automatically duri ng warehouse request document processing.\nAutomatic Wave Assignment\nYou can automate the assignment of warehouse request items to waves. EWM uses\nthe condition technique to determine wave t emplates. This enables EWM to determine\nwhich wave template corresponds to certain data from the header, item, or split\nitem of a warehouse request. An important aspect of automatic wave assignment is\nthe relationship of the warehouse request planned completion time and the wavecompletion time determined by a wave template option. The figure below illustrates\nthis relationship.\n2008 \u00a9 2008 SAP AG.

In this lesson we will review the basics of value-added\nservices.\nLesson Objectives\nAfter completing this lesson, you will be able to:\n\u0095 List examples of value-added services\n\u0095 Describe how value-added services are integrated into EWM.\n\u0095 List the levels of a value-added services order.\nBusiness Example\nIn our IDES, AG warehouse will be using value-added services for kitting.\nValue-Added Services (VAS)\nTypical Value-Added Services (VAS) ac tivities are assembling products, packing\nproducts, labeling, or kitting. Here, both the goods receipt process and the goods issue\nprocess in the warehouse change. In add ition, you can then use process-oriented\nstorage control to execute interim steps before final putaway or before staging in\nthe goods issue area. In these interim steps, the VAS order defines which product\nprocessing must be performed by warehouse employees in the work centers, forexample. You can also use a VAS order in the g oods issue process to assemble kits for\nyour customers, and to pack them on a custom er-specific basis using this VAS order.\nAs mentioned above, the VAS order is the central EWM document that controls aVAS process.\nVAS Order\nWhen created, the VAS order is the instruction to perform a value-added service(VAS) for one or more products with reference to a delivery item. A value-addedservice order (VAS order) links delivery items to a packing", "VAS Order\nWhen created, the VAS order is the instruction to perform a value-added service(VAS) for one or more products with reference to a delivery item. A value-addedservice order (VAS order) links delivery items to a packing instruction and contains\ndetails from within the delivery and packag ing specification. A VAS order is also a\ndocument with which you can inform warehouse employees about what work they\nhave to perform, and with which products. You can also use VAS orders to track work\nthat is done. This is illustrated in the figure below.\n2008 \u00a9 2008 SAP AG.

The packaging specification uses\nthe packaging specification levels to inform the VAS order about the V AS activitiesthat the w arehouse employees have to perform in the warehouse. Information in the\ndelivery provides the VAS order with the exact amount of work to be performed.\nStructurally, the VAS order contains the following components:\n\u0095 Order header\n\u0095 List of VAS activities\u0095I t e m s\n\u0095 Auxiliary products\nCreation of the VAS order can occur manually or automatically.

A sales order is created in SAP CRM that contains a kit item.\n2. For a requirement from the sales order, the system triggers the rule-based ATP\ncheck in SAP SCM. The system determines one or more rules with replacements.\nOne of the replacements is a kit.\n3. The system checks whether the kit is in stock. If the kit is not in stock, the\nproduction that is activated in the validation rule creates a kit structure thatcontains the kit components that the sy stem requires to assemble the kit. The\nsystem then performs the ATP check for the kit components and confirms the\nquantities for the sales order.\n4. The system creates an unchecked delivery in ERP without creating an SD order\n5. In ERP the unchecked delivery is converted to a checked delivery. The checked\ndelivery is replicated to the EWM system (outbound delivery request)\n6. EWM creates a warehouse request (outbound delivery order) for the outbound\ndelivery request. This process triggers the kit-to-order process.\n7.

The\ncombination of product number and serial number is unique.\nIn Extended Warehouse Management a serial number can be up to 30 characters in\nlength. However, to remain compatible w ith the SAP ERP system, the serial number\nlength must be restricted to 18 characters . There is a BAdI available, however, that\ncan be used to map EWM serial numbers to ERP serial numbers.\nSerial Number Profile\nA serial number profile is a four-character code created in Customizing, thatdetermines the conditions and business transactions for issuing serial numbers toserialized products. You must assign a serial number profile in the product master\nrecords for products that require serial numbers.\nIn the system configuration in Customizing of the ERP system, you define a\nserial number profile that is valid for all warehouse numbers, in other words, is\nwarehouse-number independent. You ca n, however, define a warehouse-number\ndependent serial number profile in Custom izing for Extended Warehouse Management.\nEWM will first search for the warehouse num ber-dependent serial number profile.\n310 \u00a9 2008 SAP AG.

In this way, you can make a product require a serial number in one\nwarehouse and not require one in another warehouse.\nSerial Number Requirement Types\nAn important setting in the serial number prof ile is the serial number requirement type.\nThis code is used to specify at what level the serial number is tracked within EWM.\nFigure", "warehouse and not require one in another warehouse.\nSerial Number Requirement Types\nAn important setting in the serial number prof ile is the serial number requirement type.\nThis code is used to specify at what level the serial number is tracked within EWM.\nFigure 1 05: Serial Number Requirement\nThe following are the serial number requirement types:\n\u0095 A- Serial Numbers for Document Items - the serial number is required only\nat the document level.\n\u0095 B-S e r i a l Numbers on Warehouse Number Level - Serial numbers are required\nfor all goods receipts/issues and are maintained at the warehouse level.\n\u0095 C- Serial Numbers required for every warehouse movement. They are\nmainta ined at the bin level.\n\u0095 D- No serial number requirement. - This setting is used primarily when some\nproducts are serialized in some warehouses but not in others.\n2008 \u00a9 2008 SAP AG.

These specific seria l numbers can be processed in EWM as shown\nin the diagram below.\nFigure 106: Ordering of Specific Serial Numbers\nIf the se rial number from ERP cannot be located in the EWM system a pick denial\nwill occur.\nProvis ional Serial Number\nAp r o v i sional serial number is Character string that the system automatically assigns\nto products requiring serial numbers (serial numbers at warehouse number level or\nin inventory management). The provisional serial number must be replaced beforethe exe cution of certain process steps in the goods receipt process, by entering a\nvalid serial number manually.\nExtended Warehouse Management (EWM) always requires the serial numbers at the\nwarehouse number level or in inventory man agement before the goods receipt posting.\nIf you set the Prov SNs indicator in Customizing, EWM automatically assigns a\nprovisional serial number, if you have not already entered a valid serial number. Youreplace this serial number with your own in a subsequent goods receipt process.\nProvisional serial numbers always begin with $ and have 30 characters.\n312 \u00a9 2008 SAP AG.

The planning data can be changed\nmanually, and then the plann ing formulas reevaluated based on this changed data. You\ncan change the aggregated information, such as planned workload and processor, as\nwell as the detailed data of the individually planned workload records, individual\nprocessors, and the results of the calculated measurement services.\nThe system only saves the changes tempor arily. When the transaction is closed, the\nsystem discards the changes.After each manual change, the system initializes the result of the planning formula.\nIf automatic planning is activated, the result is calculated again each time a manual\nchange takes place.\n2008 \u00a9 2008 SAP AG.

You map the corresponding storage bins as yard bins, which you can group\ninto yard sections, the same as for the warehouse. Storage bins in the yard are used to\nrepresent the following:\n\u0095 Parking spaces - You map parking spaces as standard storage bins with standard\nstorage sections and standard storage bin types.\n\u0095 Checkpoints - all vehicles must enter and leave through a checkpoint. The\ncheckpoint represents a supply chain unit with its own address data.\n\u0095 Doors - the door connects the yard to the warehouse. It is important for stock\nposting and yard movements.\nYard bins can also be grouped into yard sections. The following figure shows a yard\nthat has been defined as a separate storage type.\nFigure 124: A Yard Mapped to EWM Structures\nCheckp oint\nThe che ckpoint is a significant part of the yard structure because it is a location where\nvehicles and transportation units (TUs) arrive at or leave the yard.

A Transportation Unit (TU) arrives at the checkpoint and is checked-in. The\ncheckpoint is where you register the vehic les and transportation units (TUs) that\narrive in or leave the yard, by setting the status for the arrival at the checkpoint.\nRegistering vehicles and TUs that arrive in the yard is a prerequisite for yardmovements. The exact steps that are executed at the checkpoint depend on\nwhether you have obtained the vehicle data and TU data in advance through\nadvanced shipping notification, for example, or whether you first have to recordthis when the vehicle has arrived.\nIf a door is not available for loading/ unloading the TU is moved to a parking\nspace in the yard parking lot.\n2. When a warehouse door becomes availa ble, the TU is moved to the assigned\ndoor from the parking lot.\n3. The TU in unloaded.\n4. The TU is moved from the door to the checkpoint.\n5. The TU is\u0093 checked-out\u0094.\nBefore a vehicle arrives at the yard, or when i t arrives at the checkpoint, it is assigned\na TU number. The TU is, in actuality, a handling unit number assigned by the system.\nYard Movements\nYard movements enable you to move transportation units (TUs) from one yard bin to\nanother inside a yard. Possible types of yard movement are as follows:\n\u0095 The TU arrives at the checkpoint and is moved to a parking space or to the door.\n\u0095 A TU is moved from a parking space to the door, or from the door to a parking\nspace.\n\u0095 A TU is moved within the yard, from one parking space to another, or from one\ndoor to another.\nEach time you want to move a TU in the yard, you have to create a warehouse task\n(WT) manually.", "\u0095 A TU is moved within the yard, from one parking space to another, or from one\ndoor to another.\nEach time you want to move a TU in the yard, you have to create a warehouse task\n(WT) manually.
